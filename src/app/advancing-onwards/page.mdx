SASS/SCSS provides a powerful way to enhance your CSS workflow, enabling you to create reusable styles and improve the overall organization of your stylesheets.

##### JavaScript & TypeScript

JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and perform asynchronous operations, making it an essential part of modern web development.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It allows you to catch errors at compile time, making your code more robust and maintainable. TypeScript provides features like interfaces, enums, and type annotations, enabling you to write cleaner and more structured code. It is widely used in large-scale applications and frameworks like Angular and React, providing a better development experience and improved code quality.

##### JSX & TSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It is commonly used with React to define the structure of UI components. TSX is the TypeScript version of JSX, which allows you to use TypeScript's static typing features while writing JSX code. Both JSX and TSX enable you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in a more readable and maintainable way.

TSX (TypeScript XML) is a syntax extension for TypeScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your TypeScript files. It is commonly used with React to define the structure of UI components while leveraging TypeScript's static typing features. TSX enables you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in a more readable and maintainable way, providing the benefits of both TypeScript's type safety and React's component-based architecture.
