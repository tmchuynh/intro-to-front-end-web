# Individual Blog Post Pages

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

This page is dedicated to displaying individual blog posts. Each post will have its own unique content from the MDX filed located in the `content/posts` directory of your project.

## The `src/app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx` File

The `page.tsx` file is responsible for rendering individual blog posts based on the slug provided in the URL. This file will use Next.js dynamic routing to fetch and display the content of each post.
