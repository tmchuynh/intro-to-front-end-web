# Configuration and Constants

## Table of Contents

## Overview

After setting up your project structure, it's time to fill in the configuration and constants that will be used throughout your application. This includes defining global styles, metadata, and any other constants that will help maintain consistency across your project.

## `site.ts` configuration

The `site.ts` file is where you define the configuration for your site, including metadata, global styles, and any other constants that will be used throughout your application. This file serves as a central place to manage your site's settings.

```ts
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Mdx Blog Template",
  description:
    "MDX Blog Template is a simple implementation of a markdown static blog. Built with Next.js 14 and velite js.",
  author: "Your Name",
  authorImage: "/images/example-author.png",
  social: {
    github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
    linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
    gmail: "mailto:youremailhere",
    discord: "https://discord.gg/yourdiscordlink",
    threads: "https://www.threads.net/@yourusername",
    youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/@yourusername",
    instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/yourusername/",
  },
};

export type SiteConfig = typeof siteConfig;
```

This code defines a configuration object for your site, including the site name, description, author information, and social media links. You can customize these values to match your own site's branding and information.

## Constants

```ts
import { Icons } from "@/components/icons";
import { siteConfig } from "@/config/site";
import { Bot, Rss } from "lucide-react";

export const NAV_LIST = [
  { label: "Blog", path: "/blog", icon: Rss },
  { label: "About", path: "/about", icon: Bot },
];

export const SOCIALS = [
  { label: "Github", path: siteConfig.social.github, icon: Icons.github },
  { label: "Twitter", path: siteConfig.social.twitter, icon: Icons.x },
  { label: "LinkedIn", path: siteConfig.social.linkedin, icon: Icons.linkedin },
  { label: "Gmail", path: siteConfig.social.gmail, icon: Icons.mail },
  {
    label: "Discord",
    path: "https://discord.gg/yourdiscordlink",
    icon: Icons.discord,
  },
  {
    label: "YouTube",
    path: "https://www.youtube.com/@yourusername",
    icon: Icons.youtube,
  },
  {
    label: "Instagram",
    path: "https://www.instagram.com/yourusername/",
    icon: Icons.instagram,
  },
  { label: "Threads", path: siteConfig.social.threads, icon: Icons.threads },
];
```

This code defines a list of navigation items and social media links that will be used throughout your application. The `NAV_LIST` array contains objects representing each navigation item, including a label, path, and icon. The `SOCIALS` array contains similar objects for social media links.

These constants can be imported and used in various components of your application to maintain consistency in navigation and social media links.
