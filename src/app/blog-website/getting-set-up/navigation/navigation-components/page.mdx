# Navigation Components

## Table of Contents

## Overview

There are multiple components that are used to handle navigation in the blog website. These components are designed to work together to provide a seamless navigation experience.

For example, the `Navigation` component is used to render the navigation bar, while the `NavigationLink` component is used to render individual links in the navigation bar. The `NavigationDropdown` component is used to render dropdown menus in the navigation bar.

In the example regarding the `layout.tsx` file, a sidebar is used alongside a top navbar to provide a comprehensive navigation experience. The sidebar contains links to different sections of the website, while the top navbar can include additional controls or branding.

Below are some examples of sidebars, top navbars, and other navigation components that can be used in the blog website.
