# Theme Provider

## Table of Contents

## Overview

The Theme Provider is a crucial part of your blog website, allowing you to manage and apply themes consistently across your application. It provides a way to define and switch between different visual styles, enhancing the user experience.

We will be using the `ThemeProvider` component from `next-themes`, which simplifies theme management in Next.js applications.

## Setting Up the Theme Provider

1. **Install the `next-themes` package** if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install next-themes
```

2. **Create a `ThemeProvider` component** in your project. This component will wrap your application and provide the theme context.

```tsx
"use client";

import { ThemeProvider as NextThemesProvider } from "next-themes";

interface ThemeProviderProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function ThemeProvider({ children }: ThemeProviderProps) {
  return (
    <NextThemesProvider
      attribute="class"
      defaultTheme="system"
      enableSystem
      disableTransitionOnChange
      storageKey="intro-to-web-theme"
    >
      {children}
    </NextThemesProvider>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

- **`ThemeProvider` Component**: This component uses `next-themes` to provide theme management capabilities.
- **`attribute="class"`**: This allows the theme to be applied as a class on the `<html>` element, which is useful for styling with CSS.
- **`defaultTheme="system"`**: Sets the default theme to the user's system preference.
- **`enableSystem`**: Enables automatic switching based on the user's system theme.
- **`disableTransitionOnChange`**: Disables transitions when changing themes, which can improve performance.
- **`storageKey="intro-to-web-theme"`**: Sets a custom key for storing the theme preference in local storage.
- **`children`**: This prop allows you to pass the rest of your application components to be wrapped by the `ThemeProvider`.

## Using the Theme Provider

To use the `ThemeProvider`, wrap your application in it. This is typically done in the `layout.tsx` file of your Next.js application.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/ThemeProvider";
import { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Intro to Web Development",
  description:
    "Learn the basics of web development with this comprehensive guide.",
};
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

- **`RootLayout` Component**: This is the main layout component for your application.
- **`ThemeProvider`**: The `ThemeProvider` wraps the `children`, allowing all components within the application to access the theme context.
- **`html` and `body`**: The `html` and `body` elements are set up with the appropriate language and font settings.
- **`metadata`**: This object contains metadata for your application, such as the title and description.
- **`Inter` Font**: The Inter font is imported from Google Fonts and applied to the `html` element.
- **`children`**: This prop represents the rest of your application components that will be rendered within the layout.
