# Utility Functions

## `src/lib/utils.ts`

Update your `src/lib/utils.ts` file to include utility functions that can be used throughout your application. These functions can help with various tasks such as formatting dates, generating unique IDs, or any other utility functions you find useful.

```ts
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}

export function formatDate(input: string | number) {
  const date = new Date(input);
  return date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    year: "numeric",
  });
}
```

These utility functions can be imported and used in your components to help with styling and formatting. The `cn` function is particularly useful for conditionally applying CSS classes, while the `formatDate` function formats dates in a more readable way.
