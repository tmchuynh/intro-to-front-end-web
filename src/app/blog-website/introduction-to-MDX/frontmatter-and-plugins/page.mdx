# Frontmatter and Plugins

## Table of Contents

## Overview

Frontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. `@next/mdx` does not support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content. Plugins can also be used to extend the functionality of MDX, allowing you to add custom features or modify the behavior of MDX processing.

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is typically placed at the top of an MDX file, enclosed in triple dashes (`---`). It allows you to define metadata for the page, such as title, date, author, and other custom fields. This metadata can be used for various purposes, such as generating a table of contents or displaying information about the page.

```mdx
---
title: "My MDX Page"
date: "2023-10-01"
author: "John Doe"
tags: ["mdx", "nextjs"]
---

# My MDX Page

This is an example of an MDX page with frontmatter.
```

## Plugins

Plugins are extensions that can be used to enhance the functionality of MDX. They can be used to add custom components, modify the rendering process, or integrate with other libraries. For example, you can create a plugin that automatically generates a table of contents based on the headings in your MDX content.

```tsx
import { createMdxPlugin } from "next-mdx-plugins";
import { TableOfContents } from "./components/TableOfContents";
const myMdxPlugin = createMdxPlugin({
  components: {
    TableOfContents,
  },
});
export default myMdxPlugin;
```

## What We Will Use

In this project, we will use the following plugins:

### remark-frontmatter

This plugin allows you to parse frontmatter in your MDX files, enabling you to extract metadata and use it in your application.

```bash
npm install remark-frontmatter
```

### remark-mdx-frontmatter

This plugin extends the functionality of `remark-frontmatter` to work specifically with MDX files, allowing you to use frontmatter in your MDX content.

```bash
npm install remark-mdx-frontmatter
```

### rehype-slug

This plugin adds slugs to headings in your MDX content, allowing you to create anchor links for each heading. This is useful for generating a table of contents or linking to specific sections within the page.

```bash
npm install rehype-slug
```

### rehype-autolink-headings

This plugin automatically adds links to headings in your MDX content, making it easy for users to navigate to specific sections of the page. It can be configured to wrap the heading text with a link or add a separate link element.

```bash
npm install rehype-autolink-headings
```

### remark-gfm

This plugin adds support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) in your MDX content, allowing you to use features like tables, strikethroughs, and task lists.

```bash
npm install remark-gfm
```

### rehype-toc

This plugin generates a table of contents (TOC) from the headings in your MDX content, allowing you to easily navigate through long pages. It can be configured to control the depth of the TOC and the structure of the generated HTML.

```bash
npm install rehype-toc
```

## Configuring Plugins

To configure these plugins, you will need to update your `next.config.mjs` file to include the necessary settings. Here’s an example configuration:

```typescript
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx", "md", "mdx"],
  // Other config options here
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkGfm,
      [
        remarkToc,
        {
          maxDepth: 3, // Limit TOC depth to 3 levels
        },
      ],
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,
      [
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        {
          behavior: "wrap",
          properties: {
            className: ["anchor"],
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
});

// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other
export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- **createMDX**: This function is used to create an MDX configuration for Next.js, allowing you to use MDX files in your project.
- **rehypePlugins**: This array contains plugins that enhance the rendering of MDX content, such as adding slugs to headings, syntax highlighting for code blocks, and autolinking headings.
- **remarkPlugins**: This array contains plugins that process the Markdown content before it is converted to HTML, such as supporting GitHub Flavored Markdown and generating a table of contents.
- **nextConfig**: This object contains the Next.js configuration, including the `pageExtensions` setting to allow MDX files to be treated as pages in your application.

#### Customizations

You can customize the plugins and their options based on your specific needs.

- **Table of Contents**: You can adjust the `maxDepth` option in the `remark-toc` plugin to control how deep the table of contents should go.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The `rehype-highlight` plugin can be configured to ignore code blocks without a specified language, preventing unnecessary warnings or errors.
- **Autolinking Headings**: The `rehype-autolink-headings` plugin can be customized to change the behavior of how links are added to headings, such as wrapping the heading text with a link or adding specific classes to the link elements.
