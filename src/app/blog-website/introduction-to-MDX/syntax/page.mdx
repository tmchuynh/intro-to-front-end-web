## What Is MDX?

**MDX** is a hybrid syntax that blends Markdown with JSX (JavaScript XML). It enables you to write content using Markdown while embedding interactive React components directly within the same file.

This approach allows you to create content-rich pages that remain easy to write and maintain. With MDX, you can combine simple Markdown formatting—like headings, lists, and emphasis—with the full power of React for dynamic UI elements such as buttons, charts, or custom widgets.

If you're already familiar with Markdown, MDX will feel intuitive. You can continue using standard Markdown for most content, and drop in React components wherever needed. If you're new to Markdown, it’s a good idea to learn its basics first—since MDX relies on it as the foundation for text content.

Keep in mind that MDX mixes two distinct syntaxes:

- **Markdown** is whitespace-sensitive, forgiving, and user-friendly—it won't break if formatting isn’t perfect.
- **JSX** is stricter and more formal—it follows JavaScript rules and will throw errors if something is mistyped or misformatted.

In practice, MDX supports a more readable and efficient authoring experience compared to writing raw HTML or JSX for everything. For example, writing a heading or italic text in Markdown is faster and cleaner than using JSX tags:

```html
<h1>My Title</h1>
<p>
  This is a paragraph with <strong>bold</strong> text and <em>italic</em> text.
</p>
```

You can write it in MDX like this:

```mdx
# My Title

This is a paragraph with **bold** text and _italic_ text.
```

## Standard Markdown Syntax

MDX supports all standard Markdown syntax, including:

- Headings: `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.
- Paragraphs: Just write text in a new line.
- Lists: Use `-`, `*`, or `1.` for unordered and ordered lists
- Links: `[text](url)`
- Images: `![alt text](image_url)`
- Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks or single backticks (`) for inline code.
- Blockquotes: Use `>` for blockquotes.

> This is called CommonMark, which is the standard Markdown syntax that MDX supports. It allows you to write content in a way that is both human-readable and easy to convert to HTML. You can view the [CommonMark's website](https://commonmark.org/) for more details on the syntax. Ready to learn markdown in 60 seconds? Check out [this guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).
