## How to Use This Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of building a portfolio website using Next.js and TypeScript. Each section will cover a specific aspect of the project, from setting up the development environment to deploying the final product.

You can follow the sections in order, or skip to specific parts that interest you. The guide is structured to provide a  understanding of building a portfolio website, with practical examples and code snippets.

In each section, you will find:

- Explanations of concepts and technologies used.
- Step-by-step instructions for implementing features.
- Tips and best practices for building a portfolio website.

For each example, you will find code snippets that you can copy and paste into your project. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs and preferences.

At the top of each block of code, you will find a comment indicating the file name. This will help you understand where to place the code in your project structure. Sometimes, the code will be chunked into smaller parts to make it easier to follow along and understand.

There will be a variety of styles and approaches to building a portfolio website, including different layouts, color schemes, and component designs. Each example will showcase different aspects of Next.js and TypeScript, as well as various libraries and tools that can enhance your portfolio website.

Feel free to choose the style that resonates with you the most, or mix and match elements from each example to create your unique portfolio website.

Underneath many blocks of code, you will find "Customization Options" that provide suggestions for modifying the code to suit your preferences. These options are meant to inspire you to personalize your portfolio website and make it your own.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

<br />
You will see the following prompts:

- What is your project named?
  - Enter your desired project name (e.g., `my-portfolio`).
- Would you like to use TypeScript?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable TypeScript support.
- Would you like to use ESLint?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable ESLint for code quality.
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?
  - Choose `Yes` to organize your code in a `src` directory.
- Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)
  - Choose `Yes` to use the App Router for routing.
- Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?
  - Choose `No` for now, as it is still experimental.
- Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?
  - Choose `No` for the default alias.

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest
✔ What is your project named? … my-portfolio

```

This structure provides a solid foundation for your blog website, with the following key directories:

- Root Level: Essential configuration files that Next.js creates plus shadcn/ui setup
- Content: A basic content folder with one sample blog post
- App Router: Minimal routing structure for homepage and blog functionality
- Components: Basic component organization with essential UI elements
- Lib: Core utilities needed to get started
- Types: Basic TypeScript definitions

From this starting point, you can gradually add more features like:

- Search functionality
- Author pages
- Categories and tags
- Additional UI components
- Custom hooks
- More complex content organization

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see your blog website in action, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view your blog website in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic structure for your blog website, you can start building out the features and functionality.

Let's get started with the [`layout.tsx` file](/blog-website/getting-set-up/layout), which will define the global layout for your blog website.
