# Command Line Interface

## Table of Contents

The command line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with their operating system using text-based commands. It provides a way to execute tasks, manage files, and run programs without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). This guide will introduce you to the command line, its importance for developers, essential commands, and how to access Linux commands from Windows.


The **command line**, or command line interface (CLI), is like the secret back door to your computer. Instead of clicking around like a ninja mouse, you type in commands to control your operating system directly. It's a powerful tool that lets you navigate files, run programs, and manage files – all without a graphical user interface!

## Importance of CLI for Developers

Learning how to use the command line is important for developers for several key reasons:

- **Automation**: The command line allows developers to write scripts that automate time-consuming tasks, improving productivity by handling repetitive processes.

- **Cross-Platform Use**: The command line works similarly across operating systems (Linux, Mac, and Windows), making it a versatile skill for any environment a developer works in.

- **Efficiency**: The command line allows developers to perform tasks much faster compared to using a graphical interface. Commands can be typed and executed quickly, which is especially useful for repetitive tasks.

- **Server Management**: Many servers run without graphical interfaces, so managing remote servers requires command line knowledge. This is essential for tasks like deploying applications or maintaining websites.

- **Version Control**: Tools like Git, which are essential for managing code changes in projects, are often used through the command line. Understanding it helps developers handle tasks like code collaboration and version tracking.

## Accessing Linux Commands from Windows

### Setting Up WSL

You can install WSL via the command line or the Microsoft Store:

1. **Command Line**:

   - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
   - Run: `wsl --install`.

2. **Microsoft Store**:

   - Search for your preferred distribution, such as Ubuntu, and install it.
   - Launch from the Store or search for Ubuntu in the Windows search bar.

3. **List Available Distributions**:

   - Run: `wsl --list --online` in PowerShell to view available distros.

4. **Install a Specific Distribution**:

   - Use: `wsl --install -d <DistroName>`, replacing `<DistroName>` with your desired distro (e.g., Ubuntu-24.04).
   - You'll see the installation progress in the terminal.

5. **Check Installed Distributions**:

   - Run: `wsl -l -v` to see currently installed distros and their WSL versions.

6. **Install Without Microsoft Store**:
   - Use a custom image as a tar file: `wsl --import <DistroName> <InstallLocation> <InstallTarFile>`.
   - You can also download and install Appx and MSIX packages for distributions. For more details, refer to the Ubuntu WSL documentation.

### Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

To open an Ubuntu 24.04 terminal, run the following command in PowerShell:

```bash
ubuntu2404.exe
```

You can also find the terminal using the Windows search bar. After the initial setup, you'll be prompted to create a username and password, which do not need to match your Windows credentials.

### Installing Updates in Ubuntu WSL

It's good practice to install the latest updates. Run the following commands in the Ubuntu terminal, entering your password when prompted:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

**CAUTION**

Using sudo grants administrative privileges, allowing you to execute commands with elevated permissions. While essential for system administration, it carries risks. Misusing sudo can unintentionally alter critical system files, delete important data, or compromise security. Always double-check commands before using sudo to avoid making irreversible changes or affecting system stability.
