## 1.5 Developer Tools

Coding errors happen all the time, and if you're writing code, you'll definitely make mistakes – it's part of the process! But when something goes wrong with your code on a web page, the error isn't always visible to users. So, how do you figure out what's wrong? That's where developer tools come in!

**Developer tools** are built-in tools in browsers that help you find and fix problems in your code. They also give you other useful information about your scripts. Chrome¹ and Firefox are the go-to browsers for developers because their tools are the best, though other browsers have them too.

### How to Open Developer Tools

Here's how you can quickly open the tools:

On **Windows**: Press **F12** on your keyboard.
On **Mac**: Press **Cmd + Option + J**.

This will open the **console** tab in the developer tools. In this tab, you'll be able to:

- See errors in your code.
- Run JavaScript commands directly.
- Debug and fix problems!

### What You'll See

When you open the console, it will show you **errors** if there are any. For example, if you made a typo or something isn't working, the console will tell you what went wrong and where.

Hopefully, you won't see too much red anytime soon!
