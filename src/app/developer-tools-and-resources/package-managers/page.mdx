## 1.10 Package Managers

A **package manager** is like your project's personal concierge – handling dependencies, fetching libraries, and keeping everything organized and up to date so you don't have to. By automating the installation and management of external tools, it smooths out the development process and ensures your workflow stays efficient.

### Introduction to npm and Yarn

Take **npm (Node Package Manager)** for example. Think of it as your reliable coding sidekick that fetches packages (ready-to-use chunks of code) straight from the command line – kind of like summoning your project's magic ingredients with a few keystrokes. On the other hand, we have **Yarn**, a creation from Facebook's labs. The name cleverly stands for **"Yet Another Resource Negotiator,"** and it tackles some of npm's quirks, delivering faster performance and a sprinkle of extra security.

Both npm and Yarn work behind the scenes, simplifying your coding life by managing the nitty-gritty for you. Whether you choose npm or Yarn, you'll be equipped with a trusty tool that keeps your coding workflow smooth and stress-free, leaving you more time to actually build cool things.

#### What is npm?

npm is the world's largest software registry and is included with Node.js. It's free, open-source, and uses **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** for package management. npm main job is to handle dependencies and packages automatically, making **Node.js** development smoother and more efficient by allowing you to install only the modules you need. Its benefits include:

- **Ease of Use**: Simple for developers to manage and use.

- **Faster Development**: Reduces the time needed to set up and manage dependencies

- **Local Installation**: Saves space by installing packages only where needed.

npm is included with Node.js, making it readily accessible. However, different projects may require different versions of Node, and using an incompatible version can lead to errors and project failures. Ensure you are using the correct version for each project to maintain functionality.

#### nvm

Picture this: You're knee-deep in a project that demands Node 12.0.0, but your system's stuck on the ancient 10.0.0. It's like a superhero struggling with powers they can't control—frustrating and chaotic. Upgrade to 12.0.0 to save the day, only to wreck older projects still clinging to 10.0.0. Talk about a domino effect of disaster.

Enter nvm (Node Version Manager), the sleek sidekick you didn't know you needed. Forget the hassle of manually juggling Node versions—nvm lets you switch effortlessly with a single command. It keeps each project running the right Node version, turning your workflow from chaotic to classy. Say goodbye to version nightmares and hello to smooth, organized efficiency. Because managing Node versions shouldn't feel like a supervillain plot.

nvm keeps your projects happy, your errors to a minimum, and your life a lot easier.

#### What is Yarn?

Yarn is a modern package manager for Node.js, developed by Facebook, Exponent, Google, and Tilde, and is distributed under the BSD license.

Developers often switch to Yarn for its stability. Unlike npm, which may lead to inconsistencies in package versions when deploying across different machines, Yarn addresses this issue effectively.

The key benefits of Yarn include:

- **Active Community**: Yarn has a vibrant and supportive user community.

- **Local Cache Installation**: Yarn can install packages from the local cache, speeding up the process.

- **Parallel Installation**: Yarn installs packages in parallel, which is faster than npm's sequential installation.

- **Version Binding**: It strongly binds package versions, ensuring consistency.

Yarn needs to be installed explicitly by running `npm install -g yarn` to install it globally.

Running `yarn set version latest` will update to the latest version.

With Yarn, it is possible to use different versions for each project similar to using nvm for npm. Except with Yarn you would only need to run `yarn set version <version>` to change the version. No need to install a version manager.

### Comparing npm and Yarn

#### Similar Commands

- `npm init` | `yarn init`: create a new package
- `npm run` | `yarn run`: run a script defined in the package.json
- `npm test` | `yarn test`: test a package
- `npm publish` | `yarn publish`: publish a package
- `npm cache clean` | `yarn cache clean`: remove all data from the cache folder

#### Performance: Who's Faster?

When it comes to speed, Yarn excels with its ability to install packages in parallel, making the process much faster than npm, which installs packages sequentially. This parallel installation is like juggling multiple tasks at once, resulting in a more efficient workflow. However, npm has made significant improvements in its recent versions and is now quite fast as well. For developers who prioritize speed, Yarn's efficiency can be a crucial advantage.

#### Security Considerations

Yarn includes built-in security checks that are more rigorous than standard practices. While npm does offer some security features, it permits packages to execute code during installation, which can expose your project to potential risks. In contrast, Yarn enforces stricter measures to ensure that only safe packages are installed, enhancing the overall security of your development environment.
