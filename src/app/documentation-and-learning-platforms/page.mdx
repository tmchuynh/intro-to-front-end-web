# Documentation and Learning Platforms

The tools and resources available for developers are vast and varied. However, it's essential to recognize that not all tools are created equal, and some may not be suitable for every project. It's crucial to evaluate the tools you choose based on your specific needs and the requirements of your project.

It is also important to keep these resources both up to date, relevant, and **organized**. This will help you and your team to quickly find the information you need when you need it.

## Table of Contents

## Developer Resource Organization

> **📍 Moved to Developer Tools:** The bookmark manager section has been relocated to provide better organization. You can now find comprehensive information about [Bookmark Managers for Developers](/development-tools#developer-resource-management) in the Developer Tools section, where it fits better alongside other development workflow tools.

## Developer Tools & Student Resources

> **📍 Moved to Developer Tools:** The sections about free developer tools and student benefits have been relocated for better organization. You can now find comprehensive information about:
>
> - [Free Developer Tools](/development-tools#student-resources--free-tools)
> - [Student Developer Programs](/development-tools#student-resources--free-tools)
>
> These resources are now organized in the Developer Tools section alongside other development-related tools and services.
