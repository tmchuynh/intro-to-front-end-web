# The Currency Status Display

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

The `CurrencyStatus` component is a key part of the navigation menu in our e-commerce platform. It displays the current currency and allows users to switch between different currencies, enhancing the user experience by providing flexibility in how prices are presented.

This component is designed to be simple yet effective, showing the current currency and providing a dropdown menu for users to select their preferred currency. It integrates seamlessly with the global state management system, ensuring that the selected currency is reflected throughout the application.

### The `CurrencyStatus` Component

```tsx
// src/components/currency/CurrencyStatus.tsx
import { useCurrency } from "@/app/context/currencyContext";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { AlertCircle, RefreshCw } from "lucide-react";

export default function CurrencyStatus() {
  const { isLoading, error, refreshRates } = useCurrency();

  if (!isLoading && !error) return null;

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      {isLoading && (
        <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-yellow-600">
          <RefreshCw className="w-3 h-3 animate-spin" />
          <span className="text-xs">Loading rates...</span>
        </div>
      )}

      {error && (
        <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
          <AlertCircle className="w-3 h-3 text-red-500" />
          <Button
            variant="ghost"
            size="sm"
            onClick={refreshRates}
            className="p-0 h-auto text-red-500 text-xs hover:text-red-700"
          >
            Retry
          </Button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

## Next Steps

Now, we'll continue to work on the navigation menu starting with the [`CartIcon` component](/ecommerce-platform/components/navigation-components/creating-the-cart-icon), which will display the number of items in the cart and allow users to navigate to the cart page. This component will enhance the user experience by providing quick access to the shopping cart, making it easier for users to view and manage their selected items.
