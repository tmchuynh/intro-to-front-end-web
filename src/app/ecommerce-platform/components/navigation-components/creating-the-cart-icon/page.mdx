# The Cart Icon

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

The `CartIcon` component is a crucial part of the navigation menu in our e-commerce platform. It displays the number of items currently in the user's shopping cart and provides a quick link to the cart page. This component enhances the user experience by allowing users to easily access their selected items, making it convenient to review and manage their purchases.

It is designed to be visually appealing and functional, integrating seamlessly with the overall design of the navigation menu. The icon will update dynamically to reflect the current number of items in the cart, providing real-time feedback to the user.

## The `CartIcon` Component

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/CartIcon.tsx

"use client";

import { useCart } from "@/app/context/cartContext";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ShoppingCart } from "lucide-react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function CartIcon() {
  const { totalItems } = useCart();
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleCartClick = () => {
    router.push("/cart");
  };

  return (
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="icon"
      onClick={handleCartClick}
      className="relative"
    >
      <ShoppingCart className="w-5 h-5" />
      {totalItems > 0 && (
        <Badge className="-top-2 -right-2 absolute flex justify-center items-center bg-red-500 p-0 rounded-full w-5 h-5 text-white text-xs">
          {totalItems > 99 ? "99+" : totalItems}
        </Badge>
      )}
      <span className="sr-only">Shopping cart</span>
    </Button>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

## Next Steps

Now that we have our `CartIcon` component set up, we can move onto the [`WishlistIcon` component](/ecommerce-platform/components/navigation-components/creating-the-wishlist-icon), which will allow users to view and manage their wishlist items. This component will enhance the user experience by providing quick access to saved products, making it easier for users to keep track of items they are interested in purchasing later.
