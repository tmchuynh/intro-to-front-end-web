# Defining Interfaces and Utility Functions

## Table of Contents

## Overview

In this section, we will define the interfaces and utility functions that form the foundation of our e-commerce platform's type safety and data consistency. These TypeScript interfaces serve as contracts that define the shape and structure of our data objects, ensuring compile-time type checking and preventing runtime errors.

##### Why Interfaces Matter:
- **Type Safety**: Interfaces provide compile-time type checking, catching errors before they reach production
- **Code Documentation**: They serve as living documentation, making code self-explanatory
- **IDE Support**: Enable better IntelliSense, auto-completion, and refactoring capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Changes to data structures are automatically validated across the entire codebase
- **Team Collaboration**: Establish clear contracts between different parts of the application

##### Utility Functions Purpose:
Our utility functions encapsulate complex business logic and validation rules, promoting code reusability and maintaining separation of concerns. They handle common operations like data validation, formatting, and transformation, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

## File Structure

We are organizing our types and interfaces in a dedicated `lib` directory within the `src` folder. This architectural decision follows industry best practices for maintaining a clean, scalable codebase.

##### Directory Structure Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Types, utilities, and constants are logically grouped
- **Reusability**: Centralized location makes functions and types easily importable
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directory alongside implementation files
- **Scalability**: Structure can grow with the application without becoming unwieldy
- **Developer Experience**: Clear navigation and predictable file locations

##### Directory Breakdown:
- **`interfaces/`**: TypeScript interfaces defining data structures
- **`utils/`**: Pure functions for data manipulation and business logic
- **`constants/`**: Static values and configuration objects
- **`test/`**: Unit tests ensuring code reliability
- **`validate/`**: Specialized validation functions for different data types

This is what our `src/lib` directory will look like:

```

- **Compliance Support**: Helps maintain regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions

We will define a set of error messages and security constants that will be used throughout our application.

##### Message Categories:

##### Card Number Validation:
- Covers required field, format validation, and security algorithm checks
- Includes Luhn algorithm failure messaging for enhanced security

##### Cardholder Information:
- Name validation with length and character restrictions
- Balances security with international name variations

##### Expiration Validation:
- Comprehensive coverage of format, expiry, and business rule violations
- Includes protection against unrealistic future dates

##### CVV Security:
- Format and length validation specific to card types
- Security-focused messaging without revealing system internals

##### Security Boundaries:
- **Expiry Date Limits**: 20-year future limit prevents unrealistic dates
- **Name Length Constraints**: Balances legitimate names with security requirements
- **CVV Specifications**: Industry-standard 3-4 digit requirements
- **Input Sanitization**: Character limits prevent buffer overflow attacks

```typescript
// Common validation error messages
export const PAYMENT_ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  CARD_NUMBER_REQUIRED: "Card number is required",
  CARD_NUMBER_INVALID: "Invalid card number",
  CARD_NUMBER_LUHN_FAILED: "Card number failed security check",
  CARD_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED: "Card type is not supported",
  CARDHOLDER_NAME_REQUIRED: "Cardholder name is required",
  CARDHOLDER_NAME_TOO_SHORT: "Cardholder name must be at least 2 characters",
  CARDHOLDER_NAME_TOO_LONG: "Cardholder name must not exceed 50 characters",
  CARDHOLDER_NAME_INVALID: "Cardholder name contains invalid characters",
  EXPIRY_DATE_REQUIRED: "Expiry date is required",
  EXPIRY_DATE_INVALID_FORMAT: "Expiry date must be in MM/YY format",
  EXPIRY_DATE_EXPIRED: "Card has expired",
  EXPIRY_DATE_TOO_FAR: "Expiry date cannot be more than 20 years in the future",
  CVV_REQUIRED: "CVV is required",
  CVV_INVALID_LENGTH: "CVV must be 3-4 digits",
  CVV_INVALID_FORMAT: "CVV must contain only numbers",
  BILLING_ADDRESS_REQUIRED: "Billing address is required for this card type",
} as const;

// Security constants
export const SECURITY_CONSTANTS = {
  MAX_EXPIRY_YEARS_FUTURE: 20,
  MIN_CARDHOLDER_NAME_LENGTH: 2,
  MAX_CARDHOLDER_NAME_LENGTH: 50,
  CVV_MIN_LENGTH: 3,
  CVV_MAX_LENGTH: 4,
} as const;
```

#### Explanation of Error Messages and Security Constants

Our error messaging and security constant system represents a comprehensive approach to user guidance and application security:
