# Defining Interfaces for APIs

## Table of Contents

## Overview

In this section, we will define the interfaces and utility functions that form the foundation of our e-commerce platform's type safety and data consistency. These TypeScript interfaces serve as contracts that define the shape and structure of our data objects, ensuring compile-time type checking and preventing runtime errors.

### Why Interfaces Matter

- **Type Safety**: Interfaces provide compile-time type checking, catching errors before they reach production
- **Code Documentation**: They serve as living documentation, making code self-explanatory
- **IDE Support**: Enable better IntelliSense, auto-completion, and refactoring capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Changes to data structures are automatically validated across the entire codebase
- **Team Collaboration**: Establish clear contracts between different parts of the application

### Utility Functions Purpose

Our utility functions encapsulate complex business logic and validation rules, promoting code reusability and maintaining separation of concerns. They handle common operations like data validation, formatting, and transformation, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

### File Structure

We are organizing our types and interfaces in a dedicated `lib` directory within the `src` folder. This architectural decision follows industry best practices for maintaining a clean, scalable codebase.

#### Directory Structure Benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Types, utilities, and constants are logically grouped
- **Reusability**: Centralized location makes functions and types easily importable
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directory alongside implementation files
- **Scalability**: Structure can grow with the application without becoming unwieldy
- **Developer Experience**: Clear navigation and predictable file locations

## Defining Interfaces

### Product Interface

The `Product` interface represents the comprehensive data structure for products in our e-commerce platform. This interface is designed to handle the full spectrum of product information that might be returned from modern e-commerce APIs, particularly the DummyJSON API we're integrating with.

##### Key Design Considerations:

- **Optional Properties**: Most fields are optional to accommodate varying API responses and partial data scenarios
- **Nested Objects**: Complex data like dimensions and reviews are properly structured
- **Type Safety**: Specific types ensure data integrity (numbers for prices, arrays for images, etc.)
- **Extensibility**: Structure allows for future enhancements without breaking existing code

##### Property Explanations:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier, essential for database operations and React keys
- **`discountPercentage`**: Enables dynamic pricing and promotional features
- **`rating`**: Supports product review and recommendation systems
- **`dimensions`**: Critical for shipping calculations and product display
- **`reviews[]`**: Structured review system supporting user feedback
- **`meta`**: Administrative data for inventory management and tracking

```typescript
// src/lib/interfaces/product.ts

export interface ProductItem {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  discountPercentage?: number;
  rating?: number;
  stock?: number;
  tags?: string[];
  brand?: string;
  sku?: string;
  weight?: number;
  dimensions?: {
    width?: number;

  }[];
  returnPolicy?: string;
  minimumOrderQuantity?: number;
  meta?: {
    createdAt?: string;
    updatedAt?: string;
    barcode?: string;
    qrCode?: string;
  };
  thumbnail?: string;
  images?: string[];
}

export interface DummyJSONProductsResponse {
  products: ProductItem[];
  total: number;
  skip: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

### User Interface

The `DummyUser` interface defines a comprehensive user profile structure that encompasses personal information, banking details, and professional data. This interface is specifically designed to work with the DummyJSON API's user endpoints while providing flexibility for real-world applications.

      coordinates: {
        lat: number;
        lng: number;
      };
    };
  };
}

export interface DummyUsersResponse {
  users: DummyUser[];
  total: number;
  skip: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

### Cart Interface

The cart interfaces represent the complex data structures involved in e-commerce shopping cart functionality. These interfaces handle the transition from individual products to cart items, applying discounts, calculating totals, and managing quantities.

##### Interface Hierarchy:

1. **`CartItem`**: Represents a product as it appears in the cart with additional cart-specific properties
2. **`CartProduct`**: API-specific structure with calculated totals and discounts
3. **`Cart`**: Complete cart structure with aggregated totals and metadata

##### Key Features:

- **Quantity Management**: Tracks individual item quantities and total quantities
- **Price Calculations**: Supports original prices, discounts, and final totals
