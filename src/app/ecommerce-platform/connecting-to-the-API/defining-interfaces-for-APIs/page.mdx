# Defining Interfaces for APIs

## Table of Contents

## Overview

Here, we will define the interfaces for our e-commerce platform's APIs. These interfaces will help us maintain type safety and clarity in our codebase, ensuring that we can easily manage data structures returned by the DummyJSON API.

## Why Use Interfaces?

Interfaces are essential in TypeScript for defining the shape of data structures. They provide a clear contract for what properties an object should have, enabling better type checking and code readability. By using interfaces, we can ensure that our application adheres to specific data structures, making it easier to maintain and extend.

### Why Interfaces Matter

- **Type Safety**: Interfaces provide compile-time type checking, catching errors before they reach production
- **Code Documentation**: They serve as living documentation, making code self-explanatory
- **IDE Support**: Enable better IntelliSense, auto-completion, and refactoring capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Changes to data structures are automatically validated across the entire codebase
- **Team Collaboration**: Establish clear contracts between different parts of the application

### Utility Functions Purpose

Our utility functions encapsulate complex business logic and validation rules, promoting code reusability and maintaining separation of concerns. They handle common operations like data validation, formatting, and transformation, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

### File Structure

We are organizing our types and interfaces in a dedicated `lib` directory within the `src` folder. This architectural decision follows industry best practices for maintaining a clean, scalable codebase.

#### Directory Structure Benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Types, utilities, and constants are logically grouped
- **Reusability**: Centralized location makes functions and types easily importable
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directory alongside implementation files
- **Scalability**: Structure can grow with the application without becoming unwieldy
- **Developer Experience**: Clear navigation and predictable file locations

## Defining Interfaces

### Product Interface

The `Product` interface represents the comprehensive data structure for products in our e-commerce platform. This interface is designed to handle the full spectrum of product information that might be returned from modern e-commerce APIs, particularly the DummyJSON API we're integrating with.

##### Key Design Considerations:

- **Optional Properties**: Most fields are optional to accommodate varying API responses and partial data scenarios
- **Nested Objects**: Complex data like dimensions and reviews are properly structured
- **Type Safety**: Specific types ensure data integrity (numbers for prices, arrays for images, etc.)
- **Extensibility**: Structure allows for future enhancements without breaking existing code

##### Property Explanations:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier, essential for database operations and React keys
- **`discountPercentage`**: Enables dynamic pricing and promotional features
- **`rating`**: Supports product review and recommendation systems
- **`dimensions`**: Critical for shipping calculations and product display
- **`reviews[]`**: Structured review system supporting user feedback
- **`meta`**: Administrative data for inventory management and tracking

```typescript
// src/lib/interfaces/product.ts

export interface ProductItem {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  discountPercentage?: number;
  rating?: number;
  stock?: number;
  tags?: string[];
  brand?: string;
  sku?: string;
