# Users API Integration

## Table of Contents

## Overview

The Users API provides endpoints to manage user authentication and profile data in an e-commerce platform. It allows users to log in, fetch user profiles, and search for users. This API is designed to work with the DummyJSON service, which simulates a backend for e-commerce applications.

## Users API Functionality

- **GET /users** - Fetch all users with pagination
- **GET /users/{`id`}** - Fetch single user by ID
- **POST /auth/login** - Authenticate user credentials
- **GET /users/search?q={`query`}** - Search users by name
- **GET /auth/me** - Get current authenticated user profile

Manages user authentication and profile data:

- **authenticateUser(credentials)** - Login user
- **fetchUserProfile(id)** - Get user profile
- **updateUserProfile(id, data)** - Update user information
- **fetchRandomUser()** - Get random user for demos
- **fetchDemoCredentials()** - Get demo login credentials

### Data Flow

> User Input → Users API → DummyJSON Auth → JWT Token → Local Storage

### JWT Token Management

The application uses JWT tokens for authentication:

1. **Login Process**:
   - Send credentials to DummyJSON auth endpoint
   - Receive JWT token
   - Store token in local storage
   - Use token for subsequent API calls

2. **Token Validation**:
   - Check token expiration
   - Refresh token when needed
   - Clear token on logout

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Verify token before accessing protected pages
   - Redirect to login if unauthorized

## The `import` Statements

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts
import { DummyUser, DummyUsersResponse } from "@/lib/interfaces/user";
import { API_BASE_URL } from ".";
```

## `fetchRandomUser` Function

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts

/**
 * Fetches a random user from the DummyUser API.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<DummyUser>} A promise that resolves to a randomly selected DummyUser object.
 */
export async function fetchRandomUser(): Promise<DummyUser> {
  try {
    // Get a random user ID between 1 and 100
    const randomId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/users/${randomId}`);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const user: DummyUser = await response.json();
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching random user:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function demonstrates random data generation and mathematical operations for API testing:

###### Random Number Generation:

- `Math.random()` generates a decimal between 0 and 1 (exclusive)
- `Math.random() * 100` scales the range to 0-100 (exclusive)
- `Math.floor()` rounds down to get integers: 0, 1, 2, ..., 99
- Adding `+ 1` shifts the range to 1-100, matching the API's user ID range

###### Mathematical Concepts:

- This approach ensures uniform distribution across all possible user IDs
- The formula `Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min` is a standard pattern for generating random integers within a range
- Understanding this pattern is crucial for creating test data and simulations

###### API Resource Access Pattern:

- Uses the RESTful pattern: `GET /users/{id}` to fetch a specific user
- The random ID generation makes this function useful for demos, testing, and prototyping
- This pattern is common in development environments where you need sample data

###### Error Handling Strategy:

- Follows the standard async/await error handling pattern used throughout the API layer
- Logs errors for debugging while re-throwing them for upstream handling
- The function can fail if the random ID doesn't exist, but DummyJSON typically has users 1-100

###### Use Cases in Development:

- Creating demo accounts for presentations
- Populating test environments with varied user data
- Building user onboarding flows that show different user types
- Testing UI components with diverse user profiles

## `fetchUsers` Function

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts

/**
 * Asynchronously fetches a list of users from the API.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} A promise that resolves to an array of user objects.
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the fetch operation fails.
 */
export async function fetchUsers(
  limit: number = 10,
  skip: number = 0
): Promise<DummyUsersResponse> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${API_BASE_URL}/users?limit=${limit}&skip=${skip}`
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch users: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const data: DummyUsersResponse = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching users:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function showcases pagination implementation and administrative data access patterns:

###### Default Parameters for Flexibility:

- `limit: number = 10` provides a sensible default for page size
- `skip: number = 0` defaults to starting from the beginning
- Default parameters make the function easy to use while allowing customization when needed

###### Pagination Mathematics:

- `limit` controls how many users to return (page size)
- `skip` determines how many users to bypass (for calculating page offsets)
- Formula for page navigation: `skip = (pageNumber - 1) * limit`
- Example: Page 3 with 10 users per page → `skip = (3-1) * 10 = 20`

###### Query Parameter Construction:

- Uses template literals to build query string: `?limit=${limit}&skip=${skip}`
- This follows standard REST API conventions for pagination
- Query parameters are more RESTful than path parameters for optional modifiers

###### Administrative Use Cases:

- User management dashboards that display user lists
- Admin panels that need to browse through all system users
- Bulk operations that process users in batches
- Reporting features that analyze user demographics

###### Response Structure Handling:

- Returns `DummyUsersResponse` which typically includes:
  - `users`: Array of user objects
  - `total`: Total number of users in the system
  - `skip`: Current skip value (for pagination state)
  - `limit`: Current limit value (for pagination state)

###### Performance Considerations:

- Pagination prevents memory overload when dealing with large user bases
- Allows for responsive UI that loads quickly even with thousands of users
- Enables infinite scroll or traditional pagination UI patterns

## `fetchDemoCredentials` Function

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts

/**
 * Asynchronously fetches demo credentials for users.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{ ... }>} A promise that resolves to an object containing demo credentials.
 */
export async function fetchDemoCredentials(): Promise<{
  username: string;
  password: string;
  fullName: string;
}> {
  try {
    const user = await fetchRandomUser();
    return {
      username: user.username,
      password: user.password,
      fullName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching demo credentials:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function demonstrates function composition and data transformation for demo purposes:

###### Function Composition Pattern:

- Builds complex functionality by combining simpler functions
- `fetchRandomUser()` provides the base data, this function transforms it
- This is a key principle in functional programming: compose small, focused functions

###### Data Transformation and Extraction:

- Takes a complete user object and extracts only the needed fields
- Creates a new object structure tailored for authentication demo purposes
- String interpolation with template literals: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`

###### Demo and Testing Utilities:

- Provides realistic demo credentials for presentations and testing
- Eliminates the need to hardcode demo accounts
- Useful for onboarding flows where users can try the system without creating accounts

###### Object Destructuring Alternative:

- Could be refactored using destructuring: `const { username, password, firstName, lastName } = user`
- Current approach is more explicit about which fields are being used
- Both patterns are valid; choice depends on team preferences and readability

###### Error Propagation Strategy:

- Catches errors from `fetchRandomUser()` and re-throws them with additional context
- This provides a clear error trail: if demo credentials fail, you know it's likely a user API issue
- The error handling preserves the original error while adding contextual information

###### Use Cases in Development:

- Login form demos where you need working credentials
- Tutorial walkthrough where users need example accounts
- QA testing with varied user profiles
- Developer documentation that includes working examples

## `fetchUserById` Function

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts

/**
 * Fetches a user by their unique ID from the API.
 *
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user to fetch.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a DummyUser object containing the user's data.
 */
export async function fetchUserById(userId: number): Promise<DummyUser> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/users/${userId}`);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const user: DummyUser = await response.json();
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user by ID:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function represents the fundamental pattern for individual resource retrieval:

###### RESTful Resource Access:

- Follows the standard REST pattern: `GET /users/{id}` for fetching a specific user
- Uses path parameters (not query parameters) for resource identification
- This is the most common pattern in REST APIs for accessing individual resources

###### Type-Safe Parameter Handling:

- Accepts `userId: number` ensuring only valid numeric IDs are passed
- TypeScript's type system prevents common errors like passing strings or undefined values
- The parameter name `userId` is descriptive and self-documenting

###### Direct Resource Mapping:

- The API response maps directly to the `DummyUser` interface
- No additional processing or transformation needed
- This simplicity makes the function fast and predictable

###### Error Handling Consistency:

- Uses the same error handling pattern as other functions in the module
- Consistent error messages help with debugging and logging
- The error context includes the specific operation being performed

###### Common Use Cases:

- User profile pages that display detailed user information
- Authentication systems that need to verify user details
- Admin panels that need to look up specific users
- Any component that needs to display user-specific information

###### Performance Characteristics:

- Fast and lightweight - single API call with minimal processing
- Cacheable at the HTTP level (GET requests can be cached)
- Suitable for frequent calls in user interfaces
- No pagination complexity since it returns a single resource
