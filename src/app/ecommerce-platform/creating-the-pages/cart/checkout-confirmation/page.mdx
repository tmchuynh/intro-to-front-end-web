Once visitors have completed their purchases, providing them with the ability to track their orders is critical for maintaining transparency and building trust. An order tracking page keeps customers informed about the status and location of their shipments, reducing anxiety and support requests.

Letâ€™s [create the order tracking page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/order-tracking), featuring:

- **Order status overview**:
  Display real-time updates such as processing, shipped, in transit, out for delivery, and delivered.

- **Shipment details**:
  Provide tracking numbers, carrier information, and estimated delivery dates.

- **Visual progress indicators**:
  Use progress bars or timelines to give a clear view of where the order is in the fulfillment process.

- **Support options**:
  Offer quick access to customer service for issues or inquiries related to the order.

- **Mobile-friendly design**:
  Ensure the tracking page is responsive and easy to use on all devices.

By implementing a comprehensive order tracking page, you enhance customer satisfaction, reduce uncertainty, and encourage repeat business through improved transparency and communication.
