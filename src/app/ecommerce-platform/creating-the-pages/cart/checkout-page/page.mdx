  const calculateShippingCost = () => {
    const tier = shippingTiers.find((t) => t.id === selectedShippingTier);
    if (!tier) return 0;

    // Standard shipping: free on orders over $50
    if (tier.id === "standard" && totalPrice >= 50) {
      return 0;
    }

    // Premium/VIP members get free next day shipping
    if (tier.id === "next-day" && isPremiumOrVip) {
      return 0;
    }

    // VIP members get free overnight shipping on select items
    if (tier.id === "overnight" && isVip && hasVipEligibleItems) {
      return 0;
    }

    return tier.price;
  };
  ```

    toast.error("Please fill in all shipping information");
    return;
  }
  if (currentStep === 2 && !validateBilling()) {
    toast.error("Please fill in all billing and payment information");
    return;
  }
  setCurrentStep((prev) => prev + 1);
};

const handleBack = () => {
  setCurrentStep((prev) => prev - 1);
};
```

##### Explanation of the Code

This code handles the navigation between the steps of the checkout process. It validates the current step's information before allowing the user to proceed to the next step, ensuring that all required fields are filled out correctly. The back button allows users to return to the previous step without losing their input data.

```

##### Explanation of the Code

This function handles the final order placement process. It validates the shipping and billing information, calculates the final grand total, and calls the `createOrder` function to process the order. If successful, it clears the cart and redirects the user to the order confirmation page. It also provides user feedback through toast notifications for success or failure.

## Checking the Cart State

```tsx startLineNumber=386
// src/app/checkout/page.tsx
if (items.length === 0) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <div className="mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 max-w-7xl">
        <div className="py-16 text-center">
          <Package className="mx-auto mb-4 w-16 h-16 text-muted-foreground" />
          <h1 className="mb-2 font-bold text-2xl">Your cart is empty</h1>
          <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Add some items to your cart before checkout
          </p>
          <Button asChild>
            <Link href="/shopping">Continue Shopping</Link>
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

This code checks if the cart is empty and displays a message to the user if there are no items in the cart. It provides a clear call-to-action button to redirect users back to the shopping page, encouraging them to add items before proceeding with checkout. This enhances user experience by preventing confusion when attempting to check out with an empty cart.

## Rendering the Checkout Form

```tsx startLineNumber=404
// src/app/checkout/page.tsx
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">

                  }`}
                >
                  {title}

##### Explanation of the Code

##### Explanation of the Code

This section renders the order summary sidebar, providing users with a breakdown of their order costs, including subtotal, discounts, shipping fees, and total amount. It also includes a note about secure checkout. The sidebar is sticky, remaining visible as users scroll through the checkout process.


## Next Steps

After customers have completed their purchase, it’s essential to provide them with clear and immediate feedback by displaying an order confirmation page. This page reassures users that their transaction was successful and helps build trust in your platform by offering a professional, polished post-purchase experience.

Direct users to [view their order confirmation](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/cart/checkout-confirmation), where they can:

- **See a detailed order summary**:
  Display key details including order number, purchased items, quantities, individual prices, and the total amount charged.

- **Review shipping and billing information**:
  Confirm the addresses used for the order, including estimated delivery dates or shipping method details.

- **Access downloadable receipts or invoices**:
  Provide an option for customers to download or print a copy of their order confirmation for their records.

- **View next steps**:
  Clearly communicate what happens next—whether it’s expected shipping timelines, tracking information availability, or instructions for digital products.

- **Contact support**:
  Offer direct links or contact information so customers can easily reach your support team in case of questions or issues related to their order.

- **Continue shopping or explore recommendations**:
  Encourage users to stay engaged by suggesting related products, special offers, or new arrivals, leveraging the confirmation page as an opportunity for additional engagement.

Design the order confirmation page to be mobile-friendly, visually consistent with the rest of your platform, and accessible to all users. By implementing a thoughtful confirmation experience, you demonstrate professionalism, improve customer satisfaction, and reinforce confidence in your e-commerce platform.
