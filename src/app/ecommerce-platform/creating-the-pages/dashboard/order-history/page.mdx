Now that users have the ability to view their order history and track past purchases, it’s essential to provide them with full control over their account information. A dedicated settings page empowers users to manage their personal details and preferences, fostering trust and encouraging long-term engagement with your platform.

Let’s [create the settings page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/dashboard/user-settings), where users will be able to:

- **Update personal information**:
  Allow users to edit details such as their name, email address, and phone number, ensuring their profile remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Change password and security settings**:
  Provide secure functionality for updating passwords and enabling additional security options like two-factor authentication.

- **Manage shipping and billing addresses**:
  Give users an address book interface to add, edit, or remove shipping and billing addresses, streamlining future checkouts.

- **Configure communication preferences**:
  Let users opt in or out of newsletters, promotional emails, and other notifications, maintaining compliance with privacy and consent regulations.

- **Delete or deactivate account**:
  Offer clear, transparent options for users to deactivate or permanently delete their account if they choose, respecting their control over their data.

The settings page should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible to all users. By implementing a comprehensive and user-friendly account management experience, you reinforce professionalism, build trust, and support a positive, long-term relationship with your customers.
