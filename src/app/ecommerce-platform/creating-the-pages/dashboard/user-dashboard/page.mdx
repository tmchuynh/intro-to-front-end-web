Now that we’ve implemented a user dashboard to centralize account-related features, it’s time to give users clear and convenient access to their past transactions. Allowing customers to easily [view their order history](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/dashboard/order-history) not only improves transparency but also builds trust and enhances the overall shopping experience.

The order history page should enable users to:

- **Review previous orders**  
  Display a chronological list of completed purchases, including order numbers, dates, and total amounts.

- **View order details**  
  Allow users to expand individual orders to see itemized lists of products, quantities, prices, and any applied discounts.

- **Check order status**  
  Clearly indicate the fulfillment status of each order, such as processing, shipped, delivered, or canceled, with relevant dates and updates.

- **Track shipments**  
  Provide tracking links or shipment details for orders that have been dispatched, giving customers real-time visibility into delivery progress.

- **Download receipts or invoices**  
  Enable users to access downloadable PDFs or printable versions of order confirmations for personal records or business expense reporting.

- **Request support or returns**  
  Include direct links or options to contact customer service, initiate returns, or report issues related to specific orders.

The order history page should be responsive, visually consistent with the dashboard, and designed with accessibility best practices in mind. By giving customers straightforward access to their order information, you reinforce a sense of professionalism, reliability, and user empowerment—key elements for fostering loyalty and satisfaction.
