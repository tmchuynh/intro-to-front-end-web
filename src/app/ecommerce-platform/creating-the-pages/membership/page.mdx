Now that visitors have the ability to register, log in, complete purchases, subscribe to memberships, and view their purchase history, we’ve laid a solid foundation for a comprehensive e-commerce experience. However, one important feature remains missing—a way for users to save products they are interested in but not quite ready to buy.

To fill this gap, we need to create the [Wishlist](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/wishlist) page. This feature allows users to bookmark or save items for future consideration, providing several key benefits:

- **Enhanced user experience**:
  Users can easily revisit saved items without the need to search for them again, making the shopping process more convenient and personalized.

- **Increased customer engagement**:
  Wishlists encourage repeat visits by reminding users of their desired products, keeping them connected to your platform.

- **Potential sales growth**:
  By making it simple for customers to save and later purchase items, wishlists can lead to higher conversion rates and increased average order values.

- **Better marketing opportunities**:
  Analyzing wishlist data can help tailor personalized promotions, targeted emails, and product recommendations.

The wishlist page should be intuitive, visually appealing, and seamlessly integrated with user accounts. It must be accessible across devices and consistent with the overall branding and design language of your platform.

Implementing a robust wishlist feature is a strategic step toward deepening customer loyalty, improving retention, and ultimately driving more sales.
