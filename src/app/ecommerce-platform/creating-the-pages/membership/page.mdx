## Table of Contents

## The `import` Statements and Storing Data

```tsx
// src/app/membership/page.tsx
"use client";

import { membershipTiers, useAuth } from "@/app/context/authContext";
import { useCurrency } from "@/app/context/currencyContext";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { getTierBadgeVariant, getTierIcon } from "@/lib/utils/membership";
import { Check, Crown, Star, Zap } from "lucide-react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useState } from "react";
import { toast } from "sonner";

export default function MembershipPage() {
  const { user, isLoggedIn, purchaseMembership, hasMembership } = useAuth();
  const { formatPrice } = useCurrency();
  const router = useRouter();
  const [purchasingTier, setPurchasingTier] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Explanation of the Code

This section establishes the foundation for the membership page by importing all required dependencies and setting up the core functionality. The imports include several key elements:

- Authentication management: The `useAuth` hook provides access to user login status, membership details, and purchase functions, while `membershipTiers` contains the available subscription options
- Currency handling: The `useCurrency` hook ensures prices are displayed in the user's preferred format and locale
- UI components: Material design elements like `Badge`, `Button`, and `Card` create a consistent visual experience throughout the page
- Navigation: The `useRouter` hook enables programmatic navigation between pages when users need to log in or complete purchases
- State management: The `useState` hook tracks which membership tier is currently being purchased to provide loading feedback
- User feedback: The `toast` notifications inform users about the success or failure of their actions

The component initializes by extracting user authentication data, currency formatting functions, and navigation capabilities. It also creates a local state variable to track purchase operations, ensuring users receive immediate feedback when they click purchase buttons.

## Handling Purchase

```tsx
// src/app/membership/page.tsx
const handlePurchase = async (tierName: string) => {
  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    toast.error("Please log in to purchase a membership");
    router.push("/login");
    return;
  }

  setPurchasingTier(tierName);
  const result = await purchaseMembership(tierName);

  if (result.success) {
    toast.success(result.message);
    router.push("/dashboard");
  } else {
    toast.error(result.message);
  }

  setPurchasingTier(null);
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function manages the entire membership purchase workflow, implementing several layers of validation and user experience enhancements:

**Authentication validation**: Before processing any purchase, the function verifies that the user is currently logged in. If authentication is missing, it displays an error message and redirects the user to the login page, preventing unauthorized purchase attempts.

**Purchase state management**: The function updates the `purchasingTier` state to indicate which membership is being processed. This enables the UI to show loading indicators and disable buttons during the transaction, preventing duplicate purchases from accidental double-clicks.

**Transaction processing**: The core purchase logic calls the `purchaseMembership` function from the authentication context, which handles the actual payment processing and membership activation. This separation of concerns keeps the UI logic focused on user interaction while delegating business logic to the appropriate context.

**User feedback and navigation**: Based on the transaction result, the function provides immediate feedback through toast notifications. Successful purchases redirect users to their dashboard where they can see their new membership status, while failed transactions display error messages to help users understand what went wrong.

**Cleanup**: Regardless of the outcome, the function resets the `purchasingTier` state to null, ensuring the UI returns to its normal state and buttons become clickable again.

### Explanation of the Code

This section creates the complete visual layout and interactive elements for the membership page, implementing a multi-layered user interface that adapts to different user states and membership tiers:

**Page structure and layout**: The component uses a full-screen container with responsive padding and maximum width constraints to ensure optimal viewing across all device sizes. The centered layout creates a professional appearance that guides users' attention to the membership options.

**Dynamic user messaging**: The page intelligently displays different messages based on the user's authentication and membership status. Non-logged-in users see prompts to sign in or register, while existing members see confirmation of their current tier. This contextual messaging reduces confusion and provides clear next steps.

**Membership tier cards**: Each membership option is rendered as an individual card component with distinctive visual indicators. The Premium tier receives special highlighting with scaling and border effects, while the user's current tier (if any) gets a prominent green border and status badge. This visual hierarchy helps users quickly identify recommended options and their current status.

**Interactive elements**: Purchase buttons dynamically change their appearance and functionality based on user state - showing loading indicators during transactions, disable states for current plans, and sign-in prompts for unauthenticated users. This prevents user errors and provides clear feedback about available actions.

**Benefits showcase**: The bottom section uses a grid layout to display membership benefits with consistent iconography and descriptions. Each benefit is represented by a colored icon circle and explanatory text, making the value proposition clear and scannable for potential subscribers.

**Responsive design**: The entire layout adapts seamlessly from single-column mobile displays to multi-column desktop layouts, ensuring accessibility and usability across all devices and screen sizes.

## Next Steps

Now that visitors have the ability to register, log in, complete purchases, subscribe to memberships, and view their purchase history, we’ve laid a solid foundation for a e-commerce experience. However, one important feature remains missing—a way for users to save products they are interested in but not quite ready to buy.

To fill this gap, we need to create the [Wishlist](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/wishlist) page. This feature allows users to bookmark or save items for future consideration, providing several key benefits:

- Enhanced user experience:
  Users can easily revisit saved items without the need to search for them again, making the shopping process more convenient and personalized.

- Increased customer engagement:
  Wishlists encourage repeat visits by reminding users of their desired products, keeping them connected to your platform.

- Potential sales growth:
  By making it simple for customers to save and later purchase items, wishlists can lead to higher conversion rates and increased average order values.

- Better marketing opportunities:
  Analyzing wishlist data can help tailor personalized promotions, targeted emails, and product recommendations.

The wishlist page should be intuitive, visually appealing, and seamlessly integrated with user accounts. It must be accessible across devices and consistent with the overall branding and design language of your platform.

Implementing a robust wishlist feature is a strategic step toward deepening customer loyalty, improving retention, and ultimately driving more sales.
