Understanding customer behavior is key to driving repeat purchases on your platform. Many visitors may want to buy their favorite items again, but accessing past orders and personalized features requires them to have an account.

To facilitate this, we need to [create the registration page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/the-basics/registration), enabling new users to:

- **Easily create an account**:
  Provide a straightforward registration form that collects essential information like email, username, and password, with clear validation and helpful error messages.

- **Ensure security and privacy**:
  Implement best practices for password strength, data protection, and compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR.

- **Enable account benefits**:
  Highlight the advantages of registering, such as order tracking, faster checkouts, access to wishlists, membership management, and personalized recommendations.

- **Support social sign-ins (optional)**:
  Consider integrating OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) to simplify the registration process and lower barriers to entry.

By creating a seamless and secure registration experience, you increase the likelihood that visitors will become registered users, enabling them to easily revisit past orders, manage preferences, and ultimately encourage repeat business.
