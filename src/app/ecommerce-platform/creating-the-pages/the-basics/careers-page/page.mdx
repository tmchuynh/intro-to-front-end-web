## Next Steps

The Careers page is now set up to provide a comprehensive overview of job opportunities and the company's culture. The next step is to implement the [**Size Guide** page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/the-basics/size-guide), which will help customers find the right sizes for products they are interested in. This page will include size charts, fitting tips, and other relevant information to enhance the shopping experience.
