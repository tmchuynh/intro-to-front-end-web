# The Contact Page

## Table of Contents

## Overview

### Purpose

The Contact page is designed to provide users with a way to get in touch with the business. It typically includes a contact form, phone number, email address, and physical address.

### Content

The Contact page should include the following elements:

- A contact form for users to fill out
- A phone number for direct contact
- An email address for inquiries
- A physical address for the business
- A map showing the business location (optional)

### Design

The design of the Contact page should be clean and easy to navigate. It should include:

- A clear heading indicating the purpose of the page
- A simple and intuitive contact form
- Contact information displayed prominently
- A map (if included) that is easy to read and understand

### Accessibility

Ensure that the Contact page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes:

- Using semantic HTML elements for the contact form
- Providing alternative text for images (e.g., the map)
- Ensuring that the page is navigable using a keyboard
- Using ARIA roles and attributes where necessary

### Mobile Responsiveness

Ensure that the Contact page is mobile-responsive, meaning it should:

- Display correctly on various screen sizes
- Allow users to easily fill out the contact form on mobile devices
- Ensure that contact information is easily readable on smaller screens

### Usage of Constants

These structured data arrays serve as the backbone for the Contact page's content organization and user interface rendering. Each constant serves specific purposes in creating a cohesive customer support experience:

**Contact methods array**: Provides multiple communication channels with distinct visual identities through color-coded icons. Each method includes practical details like availability windows and specific contact information, allowing users to choose the most appropriate support channel based on their urgency and preference. The differentiation between standard support and premium member support creates value perception for membership tiers.

**Office locations array**: Establishes physical presence and credibility through real-world addresses and contact information. The headquarters designation adds organizational hierarchy understanding, while the structured address formatting (with newline characters) ensures proper display formatting across different UI components.

**FAQ categories array**: Creates an intuitive categorization system that helps users quickly identify the type of support they need. Each category combines recognizable icons with descriptive text, reducing the cognitive load required to navigate support options and improving self-service capabilities.

These constants enable maintainable content management - updates to contact information, new office locations, or additional support categories can be implemented by modifying the data structures without touching the rendering logic. This separation of concerns facilitates easier content updates and reduces the risk of introducing bugs during routine maintenance.

## Storing the Form Data

```tsx
// src/lib/interfaces/contact.ts
export default function ContactUsPage() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<ContactFormData>({
    name: "",
    email: "",
    subject: "",
    category: "",
    message: "",
  });

  const [errors, setErrors] = useState<Record<keyof ContactFormData, string>>({
    name: "",
    email: "",
    subject: "",
    category: "",
    message: "",
  });

  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [submitStatus, setSubmitStatus] = useState<
    "idle" | "success" | "error"
  >("idle");
```

### Explanation of the Code

This section establishes the state management architecture for the contact form, implementing a robust system that handles user input, validation feedback, and submission workflow. The state design encompasses several critical aspects:

**Form data structure**: The `formData` state uses TypeScript's `ContactFormData` interface to ensure type safety and consistency across all form fields. This structured approach prevents common errors like typos in field names and provides better development experience through autocompletion and compile-time error checking.

**Error state management**: The `errors` state maintains a parallel structure to the form data, allowing for field-specific error messages that provide immediate feedback to users. This granular error tracking enables precise validation messaging without affecting the overall form state.

**Submission state tracking**: The `isSubmitting` boolean flag prevents duplicate submissions and enables UI feedback during form processing. This prevents race conditions and provides users with clear indication that their request is being processed.

**Status state for user feedback**: The `submitStatus` state uses a discriminated union type (`"idle" | "success" | "error"`) to manage different form states cleanly. This approach enables conditional rendering of success messages, error alerts, and normal form states without complex boolean combinations.

**Initialization strategy**: All states begin with empty or default values, ensuring a clean initial user experience. The empty string initialization for form fields prevents controlled/uncontrolled input warnings while maintaining form cleanliness.

## Real-Time Validation

```tsx
// src/lib/utils/contact.ts
const validateField = useCallback(
  (field: keyof ContactFormData, value: string) => {
    const error = validateContactField(field, value, formData);
    setErrors((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [field]: error || "",
    }));
    return !error;
  },
  [formData]
);
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function implements intelligent real-time validation that enhances user experience through immediate feedback while maintaining performance optimization. The implementation includes several sophisticated features:

**Memoized validation function**: The `useCallback` hook prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the validation function, ensuring it only updates when the `formData` dependency changes. This optimization reduces computational overhead during user interactions and maintains smooth form performance.

**Individual field validation**: Rather than validating the entire form on each input change, this function targets specific fields, providing precise feedback without overwhelming users with unrelated error messages. This focused approach improves the user experience by maintaining context relevance.

**Error state synchronization**: The function updates the errors state immutably using the spread operator, ensuring React's state update mechanisms work correctly while preserving other field error states. This approach prevents validation of one field from accidentally clearing errors in other fields.

**Boolean return optimization**: By returning a boolean result, the function enables callers to make immediate decisions about field validity without additional state checks. This design pattern supports conditional logic in form submission and user interface updates.

**External validation logic integration**: The function delegates actual validation rules to the `validateContactField` utility, maintaining separation of concerns between state management and business logic. This architecture makes validation rules easier to test, modify, and reuse across different components.

## Handling Input Changes

```tsx
// src/app/contact-us/page.tsx
const handleInputChange = (
  e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>
) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  const fieldName = name as keyof ContactFormData;

  setFormData((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [fieldName]: value,
  }));

  // Validate field on blur or after user stops typing
  setTimeout(() => validateField(fieldName, value), 300);
};

const handleSelectChange = (value: string) => {
  setFormData((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    category: value,
  }));
  validateField("category", value);
};

const handleBlur = (
  e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>
) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  validateField(name as keyof ContactFormData, value);
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

These event handlers create a sophisticated user input management system that balances immediate feedback with performance optimization. Each handler serves specific interaction patterns and user experience goals:

**Smart input change handling**: The `handleInputChange` function manages text input and textarea changes with a debounced validation approach. The 300-millisecond delay prevents excessive validation calls during rapid typing while ensuring users receive feedback soon after they pause. This balance maintains form responsiveness without overwhelming the validation system.

**Immutable state updates**: All handlers use the spread operator pattern to update form data immutably, ensuring React's state management works correctly and preventing potential state mutation bugs. This approach maintains predictable component behavior and enables proper re-rendering when data changes.

**Type safety enforcement**: The explicit casting of the field name as `keyof ContactFormData` ensures TypeScript compatibility while maintaining the connection between form fields and validation logic. This type safety prevents runtime errors from typos or incorrect field references.

**Immediate dropdown validation**: The `handleSelectChange` function validates dropdown selections immediately since dropdown interactions are discrete events rather than continuous typing. This provides instant feedback for selection-based fields without the debounce delay needed for text inputs.

**Focus-based validation**: The `handleBlur` function triggers validation when users leave a field, providing a natural checkpoint for field completion. This event-driven validation feels intuitive to users since it aligns with their natural form-filling workflow of completing one field before moving to the next.

**Input type versatility**: The handlers accommodate multiple input types (text inputs, textareas, and select dropdowns) through unified interfaces, reducing code duplication while maintaining specific behavior patterns for different interaction types.

## Submitting the Form

```tsx
// src/app/contact-us/page.tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  setSubmitStatus("idle");

  // Comprehensive form validation
  const validation = validateContactForm(formData);

  if (!validation.isValid) {
    // Set all validation errors
    const newErrors: Record<keyof ContactFormData, string> = {
      name: "",
      email: "",
      subject: "",
      category: "",
      message: "",
    };

    validation.errors.forEach((error: ContactValidationError) => {
      newErrors[error.field] = error.message;
    });

    setErrors(newErrors);
    setIsSubmitting(false);
    setSubmitStatus("error");
    return;
  }

  try {
    // Sanitize form data before submission
    const sanitizedData = sanitizeContactForm(formData);

    // Simulate API call
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

    console.log("Form submitted:", sanitizedData);

    // Reset form on success
    setFormData({
      name: "",
      email: "",
      subject: "",
      category: "",
      message: "",
    });

    setErrors({
      name: "",
      email: "",
      subject: "",
      category: "",
      message: "",
    });

    setSubmitStatus("success");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Form submission error:", error);
    setSubmitStatus("error");
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

This function orchestrates the complete form submission workflow, implementing multiple layers of validation, security, and user experience optimization. The process involves several carefully coordinated phases:

**Submission initiation and state management**: The function begins by preventing default browser form submission behavior and setting appropriate loading states. This dual action ensures custom handling while providing immediate UI feedback through the `isSubmitting` flag, which can trigger loading animations and disable form elements.

**Multi-layer validation strategy**: Before attempting submission, the function performs complete form validation using the `validateContactForm` utility. This final validation step catches any missed field-level validations and ensures data integrity. The validation results are mapped to the error state structure, providing users with specific feedback about any remaining issues.

**Data sanitization for security**: Upon successful validation, the form data undergoes sanitization through the `sanitizeContactForm` function. This critical security step prevents potential XSS attacks and ensures that user input is safe for processing and storage, protecting both the application and its users.

**Simulated API integration**: The current implementation includes a promise-based delay to simulate real API communication, providing a realistic development and testing environment. This simulation maintains the asynchronous patterns needed for actual backend integration while allowing frontend development to proceed independently.

**Success state management and cleanup**: Successful submissions trigger form reset to empty states and display success messages through the status system. This cleanup ensures users can submit additional forms without leftover data while providing clear confirmation of successful submission.

**Error handling and recovery**: The comprehensive try-catch structure ensures graceful handling of network failures, server errors, or unexpected issues. Error states are communicated through both console logging for debugging and user-facing status messages for transparent communication.

**Guaranteed state cleanup**: The finally block ensures that loading states are always cleared regardless of success or failure, preventing stuck loading indicators that could confuse users or break the interface flow.

### Explanation of the Code

This section creates a multi-faceted contact interface that strategically addresses different customer communication needs while building trust and accessibility. The page architecture encompasses several interconnected components designed to optimize user experience and business efficiency:

**Hero section with welcoming messaging**: The opening section immediately establishes a supportive tone with "We're Here to Help" messaging and explanatory text that reassures users about receiving assistance. This emotional framing reduces anxiety often associated with contacting support and encourages user engagement.

**Contact methods showcase**: The grid layout presents multiple communication channels with distinct visual identities, allowing users to choose their preferred interaction method. Each method card includes availability information and specific contact details, enabling informed decision-making about timing and communication preferences.

**Integrated form and support resources**: The dual-column layout efficiently combines the primary contact form with supplementary support resources. The form includes sophisticated validation feedback through color-coded inputs and contextual error messages, while the sidebar provides quick help categories and support hours for immediate reference.

**Progressive information architecture**: The page follows a logical information hierarchy, starting with immediate contact options, progressing through the main contact form, and concluding with physical office locations and emergency support. This flow accommodates different user priorities and urgency levels.

**Status-aware user interface**: The form dynamically displays success and error states through alert components with appropriate styling and iconography. Loading states prevent duplicate submissions while providing clear feedback about processing status, maintaining user confidence during form submission.

**Office location transparency**: The office cards build credibility through specific addresses and phone numbers while using headquarters badges to establish organizational hierarchy. The "Get Directions" buttons provide practical value for users who prefer in-person interactions.

**Emergency support prominence**: The final section uses distinctive styling (gradient backgrounds and red color scheme) to highlight urgent support options, ensuring critical information is easily accessible while maintaining visual separation from standard support channels.

**Responsive design integration**: All components adapt seamlessly across device sizes through responsive grid systems and flexible typography, ensuring consistent functionality and visual appeal from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Next Steps

After implementing the Contact page, you can enhance it further by:

- Adding a map to show the office locations visually.
- Implementing server-side form submission to handle real inquiries.
- Adding more detailed FAQs based on common customer inquiries.
- Integrating a live chat feature for real-time support.

Now, you have a fully functional Contact page that allows users to reach out for support, provides various contact methods, and displays office locations. This page is essential for enhancing user experience and building trust with your customers.

The next page to design is the [**Careers** page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/the-basics/careers-page), where you can showcase job openings and allow potential candidates to apply directly through the website. This will help attract talent and grow your team effectively.
