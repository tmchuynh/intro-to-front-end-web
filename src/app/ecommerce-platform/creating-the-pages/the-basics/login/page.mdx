With login functionality in place, users can securely access their personal space within the platform. To provide a centralized hub for managing their activities and memberships, it’s essential to create a comprehensive dashboard.

Let’s [create the dashboard page](/ecommerce-platform/creating-the-pages/dashboard/user-dashboard), where users can:

- **Access an overview of their account**:
  Display key information such as membership status, recent orders, and notifications at a glance.

- **Manage memberships**:
  Enable users to view, upgrade, or cancel their memberships with ease.

- **Navigate to essential features**:
  Provide quick links to order history, wishlist, account settings, and support.

- **Receive personalized recommendations and updates**:
  Offer tailored content based on their shopping behavior and preferences.

- **Monitor activity and notifications**:
  Show recent account activity and alerts, keeping users informed and engaged.

The dashboard should be intuitive, visually consistent with your platform’s branding, and optimized for accessibility. By delivering a well-organized user dashboard, you empower customers to manage their accounts efficiently, enhancing satisfaction and retention.
