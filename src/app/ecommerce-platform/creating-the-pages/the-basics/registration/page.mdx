## Handling Input Change and Submit

```tsx
// src/app/register/page.tsx
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    [e.target.name]: e.target.value,
  });
};

const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  if (formData.password !== formData.confirmPassword) {
    toast.error("Passwords do not match");
    return;
  }

  if (formData.password.length < 6) {
    toast.error("Password must be at least 6 characters long");
    return;
  }

  if (!formData.username.trim() || !formData.phoneNumber.trim()) {
    toast.error("Please fill in all required fields");
    return;
  }

  setIsLoading(true);

  const result = await register({
    username: formData.username.trim(),
    phoneNumber: formData.phoneNumber.trim(),
    email: formData.email.trim() || undefined,
    password: formData.password,
  });

  if (result.success) {
    toast.success(result.message);
    router.push("/membership");
  } else {
    toast.error(result.message);
  }

  setIsLoading(false);
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

This form handling architecture demonstrates enterprise-level user input management and registration processing that balances security requirements with optimal user experience through strategic validation, error handling, and success management.

#### Dynamic Form Input Management

The `handleInputChange` function showcases modern React form handling patterns:

- Real-Time State Synchronization: The function captures user input changes immediately through React's synthetic event system while ensuring consistent state updates across different browsers and input devices for optimal cross-platform compatibility.

- Dynamic Field Updates: The computed property pattern `[e.target.name]: e.target.value` enables flexible form field management that supports scalable form structures while maintaining type safety and preventing code duplication across multiple input types.

- Immutable State Management: The spread operator usage ensures immutable state updates that maintain React optimization benefits while preventing state mutation bugs and ensuring predictable component behavior throughout user interaction.

- Event Handling Optimization: The destructuring pattern provides clean, efficient data extraction while supporting TypeScript type inference and maintaining optimal performance during rapid user input scenarios.

#### Comprehensive Form Validation Framework

The `handleSubmit` function demonstrates robust validation and security implementation:

- Password Confirmation Validation: The password matching check prevents user errors while ensuring password accuracy and reducing support inquiries related to password issues during the registration process.

- Password Strength Requirements: Minimum password length validation enforces security standards while providing clear feedback to users about password requirements and ensuring account security compliance.

- Required Field Validation: The validation logic ensures all mandatory fields are completed while providing specific error feedback that guides users toward successful registration completion and prevents incomplete submissions.

- Data Sanitization Implementation: The trim() method application removes unnecessary whitespace that could cause validation issues while ensuring clean data submission and preventing formatting-related registration failures.

#### User Feedback and Communication Architecture

The error handling and success messaging demonstrate user communication:

- Immediate Validation Feedback: Toast notifications provide instant feedback for validation errors that prevent user confusion while guiding correction efforts and maintaining user confidence throughout the registration process.

- Progressive Error Prevention: Client-side validation prevents common user errors before submission while reducing server load and providing immediate guidance for successful registration completion.

- Success Communication Strategy: Clear success messaging builds user confidence while setting proper expectations for next steps in the user onboarding process and membership activation workflow.

- Error Recovery Guidance: Specific error messages provide actionable feedback that helps users correct issues while maintaining positive user experience and reducing registration abandonment rates.

#### Registration Processing and Integration

The authentication integration showcases secure user creation:

- Authentication Context Integration: The register function call leverages centralized authentication logic that ensures consistent user creation while maintaining proper security protocols and data handling standards.
