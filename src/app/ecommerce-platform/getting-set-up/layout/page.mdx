# Global Layout

## Table of Contents

## Overview

Now that you have your `providers.tsx` file set up, you can create a global layout for your Next.js application. This layout will be used to wrap all of your pages, providing a consistent structure and styling across your application.

## The `layout.tsx` File

We will be adding onto the `layout.tsx` file later on in the course, but for now, we will be setting up the root layout. This will allow us to use the `shadcn/ui` components with our custom theme.

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx

import "./globals.css";
import { Providers } from "./providers";

/**
 * RootLayout is the main layout component for the "Getting Set Up" section
 * of the ecommerce platform application. It wraps all child components and
 * provides a consistent structure and styling for the page.
 *
 * @param {Object} props - The properties passed to the layout component.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - The content to be rendered within the layout.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered layout component.
 */
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className="relative flex flex-col min-h-screen">
        <Providers>
          <main className="flex-grow mx-auto mt-24 md:pb-0 w-10/12 md:w-11/12 xl:w-full">
            {children}
          </main>
        </Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code

- **Imports**: The `globals.css` file is imported to apply global styles, and the `Providers` component is imported to wrap the application in necessary context providers.
- **RootLayout Function**: This function defines the root layout of the application. It accepts a `children` prop, which represents the content of the page.
- **JSX Structure**: The function returns a JSX structure that includes:
  - An `html` element with a `lang` attribute set to "en" for English language support and `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent hydration warnings.
  - A `body` element with a class that sets up a flexible layout.
  - The `Providers` component wraps the main content to provide context and state management.
- **Main Content Area**: The `main` element is styled to be responsive, with margins and widths set to ensure proper layout across different screen sizes. The `children` prop is rendered inside the `main` element, allowing the content of each page to be displayed within this layout.
