### Security and Compliance Monitoring Implementation

#### Security Monitoring Implementation

Protect your platform and customer data with comprehensive security monitoring.

##### Real-time Security Monitoring:

```typescript
// Security monitoring system
class SecurityMonitor {
  private alertThresholds = {
    failedLogins: 5,
    suspiciousIPs: 10,
    unusualTraffic: 1000,
  };

  monitorFailedLogins() {
    // Track failed login attempts
    setInterval(async () => {
      const recentFailures = await this.getFailedLogins(
        new Date(Date.now() - 300000)
      ); // 5 minutes
      const ipCounts = this.groupByIP(recentFailures);

      for (const [ip, count] of Object.entries(ipCounts)) {
        if (count >= this.alertThresholds.failedLogins) {
          await this.triggerSecurityAlert("SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_ACTIVITY", {
            ip,
            count,
          });
          await this.blockIP(ip, "1 hour");
        }
      }
    }, 60000); // Check every minute
  }

  detectAnomalousTraffic() {
    // Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
    setInterval(async () => {
      const currentTraffic = await this.getCurrentTrafficRate();
      const normalBaseline = await this.getTrafficBaseline();

      if (currentTraffic > normalBaseline * 3) {
        await this.triggerSecurityAlert("TRAFFIC_ANOMALY", {
          current: currentTraffic,
          baseline: normalBaseline,
        });
      }
    }, 30000); // Check every 30 seconds
  }

  async scanForVulnerabilities() {
    // Automated vulnerability scanning
    const vulnerabilities = await this.runSecurityScan();

    if (vulnerabilities.length > 0) {
      await this.triggerSecurityAlert("VULNERABILITIES_DETECTED", {
        count: vulnerabilities.length,
        severity: vulnerabilities.map((v) => v.severity),
      });
    }
  }
}
```

#### Compliance Tracking Implementation

Ensure ongoing compliance with data protection and industry regulations.

##### GDPR/CCPA Compliance Monitoring:

```typescript
// Compliance tracking system
class ComplianceMonitor {
  trackDataProcessingActivities() {
    // Log all data processing activities for compliance
    const activities = {
      userRegistration: this.logDataCollection,
      purchaseProcessing: this.logTransactionData,
      marketingEmails: this.logMarketingConsent,
      analyticsTracking: this.logAnalyticsData,
    };

    return activities;
  }

  async auditDataRetention() {
    // Check for data that exceeds retention periods
    const expiredData = await this.findExpiredData();

    for (const dataType of expiredData) {
      if (dataType.shouldDelete) {
        await this.scheduleDataDeletion(dataType);
        await this.logComplianceAction("DATA_RETENTION_CLEANUP", dataType);
      }
    }
  }

  generateComplianceReport(
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  ): Promise<ComplianceReport> {
    return {
      dataRequests: this.getDataSubjectRequests(startDate, endDate),
      breachIncidents: this.getSecurityBreaches(startDate, endDate),
      consentTracking: this.getConsentMetrics(startDate, endDate),
      dataRetention: this.getRetentionCompliance(startDate, endDate),
    };
  }
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring Implementation

Track website speed, uptime, and technical performance metrics.

##### Performance Monitoring Setup:

```typescript
// Performance monitoring system
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private performanceThresholds = {
    pageLoadTime: 3000, // 3 seconds
    firstContentfulPaint: 1500, // 1.5 seconds
    largestContentfulPaint: 2500, // 2.5 seconds
    cumulativeLayoutShift: 0.1,
    firstInputDelay: 100, // 100ms
  };

  initializeWebVitalsTracking() {
    // Track Core Web Vitals
    import("web-vitals").then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {
      getCLS(this.sendToAnalytics);
      getFID(this.sendToAnalytics);
      getFCP(this.sendToAnalytics);
      getLCP(this.sendToAnalytics);
      getTTFB(this.sendToAnalytics);
    });
  }

  sendToAnalytics(metric: any) {
    gtag("event", "web_vitals", {
      metric_name: metric.name,
      metric_value: Math.round(
        metric.name === "CLS" ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value
      ),
      metric_id: metric.id,
    });

    // Alert if performance degrades
    if (this.exceedsThreshold(metric)) {
      this.triggerPerformanceAlert(metric);
    }
  }

  monitorServerPerformance() {
    // Monitor server response times and errors
    setInterval(async () => {
      const metrics = await this.collectServerMetrics();

      if (metrics.responseTime > this.performanceThresholds.pageLoadTime) {
        await this.triggerAlert("SLOW_SERVER_RESPONSE", metrics);
      }

      if (metrics.errorRate > 0.05) {
        // 5% error rate
        await this.triggerAlert("HIGH_ERROR_RATE", metrics);
      }
    }, 60000); // Check every minute
  }

  async generatePerformanceReport(): Promise<PerformanceReport> {
    return {
      coreWebVitals: await this.getCoreWebVitalsData(),
      pageLoadTimes: await this.getPageLoadData(),
      serverMetrics: await this.getServerPerformanceData(),
      uptimeStats: await this.getUptimeData(),
      recommendations: await this.generateOptimizationRecommendations(),
    };
  }
}
```
