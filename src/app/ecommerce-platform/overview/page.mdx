## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

Initialize your project with the latest Next.js template:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-ecommerce --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
cd my-ecommerce
```

### Essential Dependencies

Install the core UI and utility libraries:

```bash
# UI Components and Styling
npx shadcn@latest init
npm install @radix-ui/react-* framer-motion

# Form Handling and Validation
npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod

# Charts and Analytics
npm install recharts

# Notifications and Feedback
npm install sonner

# Development Tools
npm install @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Start with UI components using shadcn/ui as the foundation
2. **API Integration**: Implement data fetching with proper TypeScript interfaces
3. **State Management**: Use React Context for global state and custom hooks for local logic
4. **Testing**: Build incrementally with immediate visual feedback
5. **Optimization**: Apply performance optimizations and bundle analysis
