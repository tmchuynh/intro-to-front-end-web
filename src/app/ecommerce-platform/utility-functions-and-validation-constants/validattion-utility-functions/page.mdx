# Validation Utility Functions

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Validation utility functions are essential for ensuring that user input meets specific criteria before being processed or stored. These functions help maintain data integrity, enhance user experience, and prevent errors in your e-commerce platform. By implementing robust validation logic, you can ensure that users provide valid information, such as addresses and credit card details, which is crucial for successful transactions and overall platform reliability.

##### NOTE

<blockquote>
A couple of these utility functions are quite long and will be chunked up into multiple code blocks to ensure readability. Each section will have its own explanation below to help you understand the purpose and functionality of each part.

Take note of the line numbers in the code blocks, as they will help you navigate through the code and understand how each part fits together.

## Validating Address Fields from Form inputs

We will be defining the address validation utility functions for our e-commerce platform. This will help us ensure that addresses are valid and formatted correctly before being processed or stored.

```typescript startLineNumber=12
// src/lib/utils/validate.ts

/**
 * Real-time field validation for form inputs
 */
export function validateAddressField(
  field: keyof ValidatedAddress,
  value: string,
  address?: Partial<ValidatedAddress>
): string | null {
  const trimmedValue = value.trim();

  switch (field) {
    case "address":
      if (!trimmedValue) return "Street address is required";
      if (trimmedValue.length < 5)
        return "Street address must be at least 5 characters long";
      if (trimmedValue.length > 100)
        return "Street address must not exceed 100 characters";
      if (/^\d+$/.test(trimmedValue))
        return "Street address must contain more than just numbers";
      if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-'.,#\/]+$/.test(trimmedValue))
        return "Street address contains invalid characters";
      break;

    case "city":
      if (!trimmedValue) return "City is required";
      if (trimmedValue.length < 2)
        return "City must be at least 2 characters long";
      if (trimmedValue.length > 50) return "City must not exceed 50 characters";
      if (!/^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/.test(trimmedValue))
        return "City can only contain letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, and periods";
      break;

    case "state":
      if (!trimmedValue) return "State/Province is required";
      if (trimmedValue.length < 2)
        return "State/Province must be at least 2 characters long";
      if (trimmedValue.length > 50)
        return "State/Province must not exceed 50 characters";
      if (address?.country) {
        const validStates =
          VALID_STATES[
            address.country.toUpperCase() as keyof typeof VALID_STATES
          ];
        if (validStates && !validStates.includes(trimmedValue.toUpperCase())) {
          return `Invalid state/province code for ${address.country.toUpperCase()}`;
        }
      }
      break;

    case "postalCode":
      if (!trimmedValue) return "Postal/ZIP code is required";
      if (trimmedValue.length < 3)
        return "Postal/ZIP code must be at least 3 characters long";
      if (trimmedValue.length > 10)
        return "Postal/ZIP code must not exceed 10 characters";
      if (address?.country) {
        const pattern =
          POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS[
            address.country.toUpperCase() as keyof typeof POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS
          ];
        if (pattern && !pattern.test(trimmedValue)) {
          return `Invalid postal code format for ${address.country.toUpperCase()}`;
        }
      }
      break;

    case "country":
      if (!trimmedValue) return "Country is required";
      if (trimmedValue.length !== 2)
        return "Country must be a valid 2-letter code (e.g., US, CA, GB)";
      if (!isValidCountry(trimmedValue)) return "Invalid country code";
      break;

    default:
      return null;
  }

  return null;
}
```

##### Detailed Code Analysis

The `validateAddressField` function serves as a real-time validation engine for individual address components within form inputs. This function is designed to provide immediate feedback to users as they fill out address forms, enhancing the user experience by catching errors before form submission.

##### Function Parameters and Architecture:

- `field`: A type-safe key that corresponds to address properties (address, city, state, postalCode, country)
- `value`: The user input string that needs validation
- `address`: An optional partial address object used for context-aware validation (e.g., validating state codes against specific countries)

##### Core Validation Strategy:

The function employs a switch statement architecture to handle field-specific validation rules. This approach ensures maintainability and allows for easy extension of validation logic for new address fields.

##### Field-Specific Validation Rules:

1. **Street Address Validation:**
   - **Required Field Check**: Ensures the address field is not empty after trimming whitespace
   - **Length Constraints**: Enforces minimum (5 characters) and maximum (100 characters) length requirements
   - **Content Validation**: Prevents addresses that contain only numbers (suspicious pattern detection)
   - **Character Set Validation**: Uses regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-'.,#\/]+$/` to allow only legitimate address characters including letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, periods, commas, hash symbols, and forward slashes

2. **City Name Validation:**
   - **Minimum Length**: Requires at least 2 characters to prevent single-character entries
   - **Maximum Length**: Limits to 50 characters to prevent database overflow
   - **Character Restrictions**: Uses regex `/^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/` to allow only alphabetic characters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, and periods (common in city names like "St. John's" or "Winston-Salem")

3. **State/Province Validation:**
   - **Basic Length Validation**: Ensures minimum 2 characters and maximum 50 characters
   - **Country-Specific Validation**: When a country context is provided, validates the state code against the `VALID_STATES` constant for that specific country
   - **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: Converts both input and valid states to uppercase for consistent comparison

4. **Postal/ZIP Code Validation:**
   - **Universal Length Requirements**: Enforces minimum 3 characters and maximum 10 characters
   - **Country-Specific Format Validation**: When country context is available, applies country-specific regex patterns from `POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS` to ensure proper formatting (e.g., US ZIP codes, Canadian postal codes, UK postcodes)

5. **Country Code Validation:**
   - **ISO Standard Compliance**: Enforces exactly 2-character country codes following ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard
   - **Valid Country Check**: Verifies the country code exists in the predefined `VALID_COUNTRIES` list

## Validating Full Address Objects

```typescript startLineNumber=92
// src/lib/utils/validate.ts

/**
 * Comprehensive address validation with enhanced features
 */
export function validateAddressEnhanced(
  address: Partial<ValidatedAddress>
): AddressValidationResult {
  const errors: AddressValidationError[] = [];

  // Required field validation
  if (!address.address?.trim()) {
    errors.push({ field: "address", message: "Street address is required" });
  } else {
    const trimmedAddress = address.address.trim();
    if (trimmedAddress.length < 5) {
      errors.push({
        field: "address",
        message: "Street address must be at least 5 characters long",
      });
    } else if (trimmedAddress.length > 100) {
      errors.push({
        field: "address",
        message: "Street address must not exceed 100 characters",
      });
    }
    // Check for suspicious patterns (all numbers, suspicious characters)
    if (/^\d+$/.test(trimmedAddress)) {
      errors.push({
        field: "address",
        message: "Street address must contain more than just numbers",
      });
    }
    if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-'.,#\/]+$/.test(trimmedAddress)) {
      errors.push({
        field: "address",
        message: "Street address contains invalid characters",
      });
    }
  }
```

##### Comprehensive Analysis of Enhanced Address Validation

The `validateAddressEnhanced` function represents a sophisticated, enterprise-grade validation system designed to perform exhaustive verification of complete address objects. Unlike field-by-field validation, this function analyzes the entire address as a cohesive unit, enabling complex cross-field validation and relationship checks.

##### Architecture and Design Philosophy:

This function follows a comprehensive error-collection pattern, where all validation issues are identified and reported simultaneously rather than stopping at the first error. This approach provides users with complete feedback about all address problems, improving the user experience and reducing form submission attempts.

##### Error Collection Strategy:

The function utilizes an array-based error collection system (`AddressValidationError[]`) that accumulates all validation failures. Each error object contains:

- `field`: The specific address component that failed validation
- `message`: A user-friendly error description that can be displayed in the UI

##### Street Address Deep Validation:

The street address validation implements multiple layers of security and quality checks:

1. **Existence Verification**: Confirms the address field is provided and contains non-whitespace content
2. **Length Boundary Checks**: Enforces realistic address length constraints (5-100 characters) to prevent both insufficient detail and excessive input
3. **Suspicious Pattern Detection**:
   - Identifies purely numeric addresses (e.g., "12345") which are likely invalid or incomplete
   - This prevents common user errors where only house numbers are entered
4. **Character Security Validation**:
   - Uses regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-'.,#\/]+$/` to prevent injection attacks and ensure only legitimate address characters
   - Allows common address components like apartment numbers (#), unit designators (/), and punctuation

```typescript startLineNumber=131
if (!address.city?.trim()) {
  errors.push({ field: "city", message: "City is required" });
} else {
  const trimmedCity = address.city.trim();
  if (trimmedCity.length < 2) {
    errors.push({
      field: "city",
      message: "City must be at least 2 characters long",
    });
  } else if (trimmedCity.length > 50) {
    errors.push({
      field: "city",
      message: "City must not exceed 50 characters",
    });
  } else if (!/^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/.test(trimmedCity)) {
    errors.push({
      field: "city",
      message:
        "City can only contain letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, and periods",
    });
  }
}
```

##### City Name Validation Deep Dive:

The city validation logic implements geographically-aware validation rules:

1. **Presence Verification**: Ensures the city field contains meaningful content after whitespace trimming
2. **Realistic Length Constraints**:
   - Minimum 2 characters prevents single-letter entries (which are invalid for city names)
   - Maximum 50 characters accommodates even the longest legitimate city names while preventing abuse
3. **Geographic Character Set Validation**:
   - Regex `/^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/` specifically allows characters commonly found in international city names
   - Supports hyphenated cities (e.g., "Winston-Salem"), possessive forms (e.g., "St. John's"), and abbreviated forms (e.g., "St. Petersburg")
   - Excludes numbers and special characters that don't belong in city names

```typescript startLineNumber=154
if (!address.state?.trim()) {
  errors.push({ field: "state", message: "State/Province is required" });
} else {
  const trimmedState = address.state.trim();
  if (trimmedState.length < 2) {
    errors.push({
      field: "state",
      message: "State/Province must be at least 2 characters long",
    });
  } else if (trimmedState.length > 50) {
    errors.push({
      field: "state",
      message: "State/Province must not exceed 50 characters",
    });
  }
}
```

##### State/Province Validation Framework:

The state validation system implements a flexible, jurisdiction-aware approach:

1. **Universal Requirements**: Establishes basic length constraints (2-50 characters) that work across different governmental systems
2. **Preparatory Structure**: While this section focuses on basic validation, the architecture supports integration with country-specific state validation (implemented in later sections)
3. **International Flexibility**: The broad length range accommodates various administrative division naming conventions worldwide, from short state codes to longer provincial names

```typescript startLineNumber=171
if (!address.postalCode?.trim()) {
  errors.push({
    field: "postalCode",
    message: "Postal/ZIP code is required",
  });
} else {
  const trimmedPostalCode = address.postalCode.trim();
  if (trimmedPostalCode.length < 3) {
    errors.push({
      field: "postalCode",
      message: "Postal/ZIP code must be at least 3 characters long",
    });
  } else if (trimmedPostalCode.length > 10) {
    errors.push({
      field: "postalCode",
      message: "Postal/ZIP code must not exceed 10 characters",
    });
  }
}
```

##### Postal Code Foundation Validation:

This section establishes universal postal code requirements that serve as a foundation for more specific country-based validation:

1. **Universal Length Standards**: The 3-10 character range accommodates the vast majority of international postal code systems
2. **Preparation for Format-Specific Validation**: While basic length validation occurs here, the architecture prepares for country-specific format validation implemented in subsequent code sections
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: These constraints ensure compatibility with various international addressing standards while preventing obviously invalid inputs

```typescript startLineNumber=191
if (!address.country?.trim()) {
  errors.push({ field: "country", message: "Country is required" });
} else {
  const trimmedCountry = address.country.trim().toUpperCase();
  if (trimmedCountry.length !== 2) {
    errors.push({
      field: "country",
      message: "Country must be a valid 2-letter code (e.g., US, CA, GB)",
    });
  } else if (!isValidCountry(trimmedCountry)) {
    errors.push({ field: "country", message: "Invalid country code" });
  }
}
```

##### Country Code Standardization and Validation:

The country validation implements strict ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 compliance:

1. **ISO Standard Enforcement**: Requires exactly 2-character country codes, ensuring consistency with international addressing standards
2. **Case-Insensitive Processing**: Converts input to uppercase for standardized comparison while maintaining user input flexibility
3. **Authority Validation**: Verifies country codes against the authoritative `VALID_COUNTRIES` constant, preventing invalid or obsolete country codes
4. **Foundation for Contextual Validation**: Establishes the country context that enables subsequent postal code and state validation logic

```typescript startLineNumber=205
// Country-specific validation
if (address.country && address.postalCode) {
  const countryCode = address.country.toUpperCase();
  const pattern =
    POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS[countryCode as keyof typeof POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS];

  if (pattern && !pattern.test(address.postalCode.trim())) {
    errors.push({
      field: "postalCode",
      message: `Invalid postal code format for ${countryCode}`,
    });
  }
}
```

##### Advanced Country-Specific Postal Code Validation:

This sophisticated validation layer implements geographically-aware postal code format verification:

1. **Dynamic Pattern Retrieval**: Accesses country-specific regex patterns from the `POSTAL_CODE_PATTERNS` constant, enabling precise format validation for different nations
2. **Conditional Validation Logic**: Only applies format validation when both country and postal code are provided, and a specific pattern exists for that country
3. **Format Examples by Country**:
   - **United States**: 5-digit ZIP codes (12345) or 9-digit ZIP+4 codes (12345-6789)
   - **Canada**: 6-character alternating letter-number format (A1A 1A1)
   - **United Kingdom**: Variable-length alphanumeric postcodes (SW1A 1AA, M1 1AA)
   - **Germany**: 5-digit numeric codes (10115)
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If no specific pattern exists for a country, the validation relies on the universal length requirements established earlier

```typescript startLineNumber=219
// State validation for specific countries
if (address.country && address.state) {
  const countryCode = address.country.toUpperCase();
  const validStates = VALID_STATES[countryCode as keyof typeof VALID_STATES];

  if (validStates && !validStates.includes(address.state.toUpperCase())) {
    errors.push({
      field: "state",
      message: `Invalid state/province code for ${countryCode}`,
    });
  }
}
```

##### Sophisticated State/Province Cross-Validation:

This advanced validation mechanism implements jurisdiction-specific state validation:

1. **Conditional Cross-Validation**: Activates only when both country and state information are available, enabling intelligent geographic verification
2. **Dynamic State Registry Access**: Retrieves country-specific valid state lists from the `VALID_STATES` constant, supporting different governmental administrative structures
3. **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: Normalizes both input and reference data to uppercase for reliable comparison
4. **Country-Specific Examples**:
   - **United States**: Validates against 50 state codes plus DC (e.g., CA, NY, TX, FL)
   - **Canada**: Verifies provincial and territorial codes (e.g., ON, BC, QC, AB)
   - **Australia**: Checks state and territory abbreviations (e.g., NSW, VIC, QLD, WA)
5. **Intelligent Fallback**: For countries without defined state lists, the validation gracefully skips state verification rather than causing errors

```typescript startLineNumber=232
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  };
}
```

##### Validation Result Assembly and Return Strategy:

The function concludes with a comprehensive result compilation:

1. **Validation Success Determination**: Uses the absence of errors (`errors.length === 0`) as the success criterion, ensuring all validation rules have passed
2. **Complete Error Reporting**: Returns all accumulated validation errors, enabling comprehensive user feedback and debugging
3. **Type-Safe Return Structure**: Implements the `AddressValidationResult` interface, ensuring consistent error handling throughout the application
4. **Integration-Ready Output**: The result format is designed for seamless integration with form validation libraries and user interface error display systems

      message: "Country must be a valid 2-letter code (e.g., US, CA, GB)",
    });
  }

  // Country-specific validation

      });
    }
  }

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  };
}
```

##### Streamlined Address Validation Architecture

The `validateAddress` function implements a more streamlined approach to address validation, designed for scenarios where comprehensive error collection is needed but with a more direct, performance-optimized validation flow. This function serves as an alternative to the enhanced validation method, providing the same thoroughness with a more concise implementation.

##### Architectural Design Philosophy:

This function follows a linear validation approach, systematically checking each address component in sequence. Unlike the enhanced version, it uses immediate conditional checks with `else if` chains, creating a more predictable execution path and potentially better performance for large-scale validation operations.

##### Comprehensive Field-by-Field Analysis:

##### Street Address Validation Logic:

- **Existence and Trimming**: Verifies address presence and removes extraneous whitespace
- **Length Boundary Enforcement**: Implements the same 5-100 character constraints as the enhanced version
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Uses direct conditional statements for more straightforward debugging and maintenance

##### City Validation Implementation:

- **Multi-Layered Length Validation**: Enforces 2-50 character constraints through sequential checks
- **Advanced Character Set Validation**: Implements the same geographic character restrictions using `/^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/`
- **International Name Support**: Accommodates complex city names across different linguistic and cultural contexts

##### State/Province Processing:

- **Basic Constraint Enforcement**: Applies universal 2-50 character length requirements
- **Preparation for Geographic Validation**: Sets foundation for country-specific state validation logic implemented later in the function

##### Postal Code Framework:

- **Universal Standards Application**: Enforces the internationally-compatible 3-10 character range
- **Format Validation Preparation**: Establishes groundwork for country-specific pattern matching

##### Country Code Verification:

- **ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Compliance**: Strictly enforces 2-character country code format
- **Authority Verification Preparation**: Sets up for validation against the authoritative country registry

##### Advanced Cross-Validation Features:

##### Geographic Postal Code Validation:

The function implements the same sophisticated country-specific postal code validation as the enhanced version:

- **Dynamic Pattern Application**: Retrieves and applies country-specific regex patterns
- **Multi-National Format Support**: Handles diverse postal code formats from different countries
- **Intelligent Error Messaging**: Provides country-specific error messages for better user understanding

##### Jurisdiction-Aware State Validation:

Implements comprehensive state/province validation with geographic intelligence:

- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verifies state codes against country-specific registries
- **Case-Insensitive Processing**: Normalizes input for reliable comparison
- **Administrative Division Support**: Accommodates different governmental organizational structures

##### Return Value and Integration:

The function returns the same `AddressValidationResult` structure, ensuring API consistency across different validation approaches while providing complete error reporting and validation status information.

## Handling Addresses

```typescript startLineNumber=354
/**
 * Validates and normalizes an address
 */
export function validateAndNormalizeAddress(
  address: Partial<ValidatedAddress>
): {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: AddressValidationError[];
  normalizedAddress?: ValidatedAddress;
} {
  const validation = validateAddress(address);

  if (!validation.isValid) {
    return validation;
  }

  // Normalize the address
  const normalizedAddress: ValidatedAddress = {
    address: address.address!.trim(),
    city: address.city!.trim().replace(/\b\w/g, (l) => l.toUpperCase()), // Title case
    state: address.state!.trim().toUpperCase(),
    postalCode: address.postalCode!.trim().toUpperCase(),
    country: address.country!.trim().toUpperCase(),
  };

  return {
    isValid: true,
    errors: [],
    normalizedAddress,
  };
}
```

##### Advanced Address Processing and Normalization System

The `validateAndNormalizeAddress` function represents a sophisticated two-phase address processing system that combines comprehensive validation with intelligent data normalization. This function is essential for maintaining consistent address data across your e-commerce platform while ensuring data quality and standardization.

##### Two-Phase Processing Architecture:

##### Phase 1: Comprehensive Validation

The function begins by leveraging the robust `validateAddress` function to perform exhaustive address verification. This approach follows the single-responsibility principle by delegating validation logic to the specialized validation function while focusing on the normalization workflow.

##### Early Return Strategy:

If validation fails, the function implements an early return pattern, immediately providing validation results without attempting normalization. This prevents processing of invalid data and ensures that only verified addresses proceed to the normalization phase.

##### Phase 2: Intelligent Data Normalization

When validation succeeds, the function performs sophisticated data standardization:

##### Address Field Processing:

- **Whitespace Normalization**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace while preserving internal spacing
- **Content Preservation**: Maintains the original address structure and casing to preserve user intent and readability

##### City Name Standardization:

- **Title Case Transformation**: Implements intelligent capitalization using the regex replacement `/\b\w/g` with the callback `(l) => l.toUpperCase()`
- **Word Boundary Recognition**: The `\b` boundary ensures only the first letter of each word is capitalized
- **International Compatibility**: Handles complex city names with multiple words, hyphens, and apostrophes correctly
- **Examples**: "new york" becomes "New York", "san francisco" becomes "San Francisco"

##### State/Province Standardization:

- **Uppercase Conversion**: Ensures consistent state representation for database storage and comparison
- **Code Standardization**: Normalizes state abbreviations (e.g., "ca" becomes "CA", "ny" becomes "NY")

##### Postal Code Normalization:

- **Format Standardization**: Converts postal codes to uppercase for consistent formatting
