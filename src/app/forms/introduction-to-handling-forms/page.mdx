# Forms and Inputs

## Table of Contents

Forms are a fundamental part of web applications, allowing users to submit data that can be processed by the server. This page provides an overview of how to create and manage forms in HTML.

Forms `<form>` are essential for collecting user input and can contain a variety of input elements.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

**Input Types**: The `<input>` element can take various types such as text, email, password, checkbox, radio, file, and more, allowing for diverse forms of user input.

**Labels and Accessibility**: Each input should ideally be paired with a `<label>` element to improve accessibility. This helps screen readers and makes the form more user-friendly.

## Submitting Forms

When a form is submitted, the browser sends the data to the server specified in the `action` attribute using the method defined in the `method` attribute. The server can then process this data accordingly.
