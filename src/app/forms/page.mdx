#  Forms and Inputs

Forms `<form>` are essential for collecting user input and can contain a variety of input elements.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

**Input Types**: The `<input>` element can take various types such as text, email, password, checkbox, radio, file, and more, allowing for diverse forms of user input.

**Labels and Accessibility**: Each input should ideally be paired with a `<label>` element to improve accessibility. This helps screen readers and makes the form more user-friendly.
