## Form Validation

Form validation is crucial for ensuring that the data submitted by users meets specific criteria. HTML5 provides built-in validation features that can be used to enforce rules on form inputs.

### Built-in Validation

HTML5 includes several attributes that can be used for validation:
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `required` | Specifies that an input must be filled out before submitting the form. |
| `minlength` | Sets the minimum number of characters required in an input field. |
| `maxlength` | Sets the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field. |
| `pattern` | Specifies a regular expression that the input value must match. |
| `type` | Defines the type of input (e.g., `email`, `number`, `url`) which automatically applies validation rules. |

### Custom Validation

For more complex validation, you can use JavaScript to create custom validation logic. This allows you to check conditions that are not covered by HTML5 attributes, such as cross-field validation or asynchronous checks.

```javascript
document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  const nameInput = document.getElementById("name");
  if (nameInput.value.trim() === "") {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
    alert("Name is required.");
  }
});
```

### Example of Form Validation

```html
<form id="myForm" action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="username"
    name="username"
    required
    minlength="3"
    maxlength="20"
    pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"
  />
  <span class="error" id="usernameError"></span>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
  <span class="error" id="emailError"></span>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  document
    .getElementById("myForm")
    .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      let valid = true;

      const username = document.getElementById("username");
      const usernameError = document.getElementById("usernameError");
      if (!username.checkValidity()) {
        usernameError.textContent =
          "Username must be 3-20 characters long and contain only letters and numbers.";
        valid = false;
      } else {
        usernameError.textContent = "";
      }

      const email = document.getElementById("email");
      const emailError = document.getElementById("emailError");
      if (!email.checkValidity()) {
        emailError.textContent = "Please enter a valid email address.";
        valid = false;
      } else {
        emailError.textContent = "";
      }

      if (!valid) {
        event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission if validation fails
      }
    });
</script>
```

## Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are pattern-hunting tools for strings. They consist of sequences of characters that define specific search patterns, making them perfect for tasks like finding, matching, or manipulating strings. Whether you're searching for a specific word or cleaning up data, regex is your go-to Swiss Army knife for all things text-related!

Regex serves several key functions in text processing, including:

- **Searching for Specific Patterns**: Regex allows you to find particular sequences of characters within larger texts. For example, you can search for email addresses, phone numbers, or specific words within a document.

- **Extracting Submatch Information**: Regex can be used to extract specific parts of a string that match defined patterns. This is particularly useful in data processing where you may want to isolate specific elements from a larger dataset.

- **Testing for Matches**: You can use regex to check if a given string conforms to a particular pattern. This is often used in form validation to ensure user inputs follow expected formats (like checking if an email address is valid).

- **Replacing Patterns**: Regex can also be used to search for patterns and replace them with other strings. This is useful in data cleaning or formatting tasks.

Regex is like the Swiss Army knife of text – it's everywhere, from coding to data wrangling:

- **Programming Languages**: In JavaScript, Python, and others, regex is your go-to for wrestling with strings and patterns.
- **Web Development**: Think of it as your bouncer, making sure emails and passwords behave before entering the party (aka your form).
- **Data Science**: Regex is like the mop that cleans up messy text data, helping data scientists tidy up and make sense of it all.
- **NLP**: In natural language processing, regex is the detective, spotting patterns in unstructured text and making sense of the chaos.
- **Text Analytics**: It's like Ctrl+F on steroids, finding insights and trends in oceans of text with surgical precision.

###### Example: Splitting Full Names

Suppose you want to split a column of full names into title, first name, and surname columns in a dataset. You can define a regex pattern to separate the columns whenever it encounters a space character. Here's how you might do it:

```javascript
const names = "Mr. John Doe, Mrs. Jane Smith, Dr. Emily Johnson";

const regex = /(Mr\.|Mrs\.|Dr\.)\s([A-Za-z]+)\s([A-Za-z]+)/g;

let match;
while ((match = regex.exec(names)) !== null) {
  console.log(
    `Title: ${match[1]}, First Name: ${match[2]}, Last Name: ${match[3]}`,
  );
}
```

Output:

```bash
Title: Mr., First Name: John, Last Name: Doe
Title: Mrs., First Name: Jane, Last Name: Smith
Title: Dr., First Name: Emily, Last Name: Johnson
```

Regex, or Regular Expressions, operates like a highly skilled filter that processes strings according to a defined pattern. Think of it as a discerning bouncer at an exclusive club, accepting only those who meet specific criteria while politely turning away the rest. By matching strings that conform to a specified format, regex ensures that only the right data gets through.

To fully appreciate how regex works, it's essential to understand the following key components:

- **Literals**: Characters that match themselves. For example, `cat` matches "cat" in a string – straightforward!

- **Meta-characters**: These are special characters with superpowers:
  - `.` (dot) matches any character (except newline).
  - `*` matches zero or more of the previous element.
  - `+` matches one or more of the previous element.
  - `?` makes the previous element optional.

- **Character Classes**: Use square brackets to match any one character from a set. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

- **Anchors**: These pin your search to specific positions: `^` for the start of a string, `$` for the end.

- **Groups**: Use parentheses to group patterns together, so you can apply actions to the whole set. For example, `(abc)+` matches "abc" one or more times.

### Regex Patterns

Crafting regex is like building a map to find treasure – spot the patterns, build the right path, and test it out!

1. **Spot the Patterns**: Look at your data. What do they have in common? For example, names like "Mr. John Doe" follow a pattern: Title, Firstname, Lastname.

2. **Build the Pattern**: Use regex magic to capture those parts. For a name like "Mr. John Doe," you’d use something like: `(Mr\.|Mrs\.|Dr\.)\s([A-Za-z]+)\s([A-Za-z]+)`

3. **Test It**: Now, test your pattern using a handy tool like Regex101. Make sure it catches the right stuff!

4. **Tweak and Perfect**: Fine-tune your regex to handle tricky cases or avoid matching the wrong things.

Regex is a powerful tool – once you master it, you can tackle everything from data validation to text search like a regex wizard!

## Validation Examples

Form validation is essential for ensuring that user input meets specific criteria before submission. This section covers various validation techniques, including regex, length validation, required field validation, file type and size validation, data type validation, and password validation. Each technique is explained with examples to illustrate its usage.

### Length Validation

Length validation ensures that input meets specified minimum and maximum length requirements. It's especially handy for fields like usernames or passwords, where you want to maintain a balance between complexity and usability. Think of it like setting the perfect recipe: too little, and it's not secure; too much, and it's hard to remember!

```javascript
function validateLength(input, minLength, maxLength) {
  return input.length >= minLength && input.length <= maxLength;
}
```

### Required Field Validation

Required field validation ensures that specific fields are filled out before submitting a form. It's like checking if all the must-have ingredients are in your recipe—without them, the dish (or form) can't be completed!

```javascript
function validateRequiredField(input) {
  return input.trim() !== "";
}
```

### File Type and Size Validation

When dealing with file uploads, it's important to validate both the file type and size to ensure users submit acceptable files. This helps maintain security and prevents server overload. It's like checking if the ingredients are fresh and within the right quantity before adding them to your dish!

```javascript
function validateFile(file) {
  const allowedTypes = ["image/jpeg", "image/png"];
  const maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2 MB

  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    console.log("Invalid file type");
    return false;
  }

  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    console.log("File size exceeds the limit");
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Data Type Validation

Data type validation ensures that input matches the expected type, like confirming if a value is a number, a string, or any other data type. It's like making sure the right ingredients go into a recipe—no mixing up sugar with salt!

```javascript
function validateNumber(input) {
  return !isNaN(input);
}
```

### Password Validation

Password validation is crucial for ensuring that users create strong and secure passwords. This can include checking for minimum length, complexity (like requiring uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and confirming that the password matches a confirmation field. It's like setting the right security measures for your recipe book—strong enough to keep it safe!

```javascript
function validatePassword(password, confirmPassword) {
  return password === confirmPassword;
}
```

### Credit Card Validation

Credit card validation ensures that the input matches the format of a valid credit card number. This can include checking the length, format (like only allowing digits), and using algorithms like the Luhn algorithm to verify the number's validity. It's like checking if your credit card is valid before making a purchase—ensuring everything is in order before proceeding!

```javascript
function validateCreditCard(cardNumber) {
  const regex = /^\d{16}$/; // Example for a 16-digit card number
  return regex.test(cardNumber);
}
```

### Email Validation

Email validation ensures that the input matches the format of a valid email address. This can include checking for the presence of an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a valid top-level domain (TLD). It's like making sure your email address is correctly formatted before sending a message—ensuring it reaches the right destination!

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
```

### URL Validation

URL validation ensures that the input matches the format of a valid URL. This can include checking for the presence of a protocol (like "http://" or "https://"), a domain name, and an optional path or query string. It's like making sure your website address is correctly formatted before sharing it—ensuring it leads to the right place!

```javascript
function validateURL(url) {
  const regex = /^(https?:\/\/)?[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*$/;
  return regex.test(url);
}
```

### Phone Number Validation

Phone number validation ensures that the input matches the format of a valid phone number. This can include checking for the presence of digits, optional country codes, and specific formats (like parentheses or dashes). It's like making sure your phone number is correctly formatted before sharing it—ensuring it can be dialed correctly!

```javascript
function validatePhoneNumber(phoneNumber) {
  const regex = /^\+?[1-9]\d{1,14}$/; // Example for E.164 format
  return regex.test(phoneNumber);
}
```
