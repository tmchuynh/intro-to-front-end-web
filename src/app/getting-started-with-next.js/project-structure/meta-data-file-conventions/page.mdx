# Meta Data File Conventions

## Table of Contents

## Overview

Meta data files in Next.js are used to define the structure and behavior of pages within the application. These files typically include configuration settings, metadata, and other information that helps Next.js understand how to render and manage the pages. The conventions for naming and organizing these files are crucial for maintaining a clean and efficient project structure.

## App Icons

App icons are typically stored in the `public` directory of a Next.js application.
| Name | File Extension(s) | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `facicon`| `.ico` | A favicon file that represents the application in browser tabs and bookmarks. It is a small icon that appears next to the page title in the browser. |
| `icon` | `.ico`, `.jpg`, `jpeg`, `.png`, `.svg` | These files are used as the app icon files. |
| `icon` | `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`| These are used as the generated app icon files. They are typically used to dynamically generate icons based on the application's configuration or state. |
| `apple-icon` | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` | These files are used as the Apple app icon files. They are specifically designed for Apple devices and are used to represent the application on iOS and macOS. |
| `apple-icon` | `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx` | These are used as the generated Apple app icon files. Similar to the generic app icon files, they are used to dynamically generate icons for Apple devices based on the application's configuration or state. |

## Open Graph and Twitter Images

Open Graph and Twitter images are used to define how the application appears when shared on social media platforms. These images are typically specified in the meta tags of the HTML document and can be customized for each page.
| Name | File Extension(s) | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `opengraph-image` | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` | These files are used as the Open Graph image files. They define how the application appears when shared on social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. |
| `opengraph-image` | `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx` | These are used as the generated Open Graph image files. They are typically used to dynamically generate images based on the application's configuration or state. |
| `twitter-image` | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` | These files are used as the Twitter image files. They define how the application appears when shared on Twitter. |
| `twitter-image` | `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx` | These are used as the generated Twitter image files. Similar to the Open Graph image files, they are used to dynamically generate images for Twitter based on the application's configuration or state. |

## SEO

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is crucial for improving the visibility of a Next.js application in search engine results. Meta data files can include various SEO-related tags and configurations to enhance the application's search engine ranking.
| Name | File Extension(s) | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `sitemap` | `.xml` | A sitemap file that lists all the pages of the application, helping search engines crawl and index the content effectively. It provides a structured overview of the site's content. |
| `sitemap` | `.js`, `.ts` | These are used as the generated sitemap files. They can dynamically generate the sitemap based on the application's routes and content, ensuring that search engines have the most up-to-date information. |
| `robots` | `.txt` | A robots.txt file that provides instructions to search engine crawlers about which pages to index and which to ignore. It helps control the crawling behavior of search engines. |
| `robots` | `.js`, `.ts` | These are used as the generated robots.txt files. They can dynamically generate the robots.txt file based on the application's configuration, allowing for more flexibility in controlling search engine crawling behavior. |
