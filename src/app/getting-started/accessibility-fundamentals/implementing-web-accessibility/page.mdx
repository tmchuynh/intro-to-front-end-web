## Web Accessibility Implementation 1-2-3

Web accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with your website. It involves designing and developing websites that are usable by people with various disabilities, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Accessibility is not just a legal requirement in many jurisdictions; it is also a moral obligation to ensure that everyone can access information and services online.

### Keyboard Focus Indicators

Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus indicators:

```css
button:focus,
input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #007cba;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### ARIA Roles and Attributes

Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility:

```html
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Main Navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Alt Text for Images

Always provide descriptive alt text for images:

```html
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from January to March 2023" />
```

### Proper Heading Structure

Use headings hierarchically:

```html
<h1>Main Topic</h1>
<h2>Subtopic</h2>
<h3>Sub-subtopic</h3>
<h2>Another Subtopic</h2>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible:

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #007cba;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Color Contrast

Ensure sufficient color contrast:

- Normal text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum
- Large text: 3:1 ratio minimum

```css
body {
  color: #333;
  background-color: #fff;
}
a {
  color: #007cba;
}
a:hover {
  color: #005f8a;
}
```
