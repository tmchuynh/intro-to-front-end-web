# The Logistics of Web Accessibility

## Table of Contents

## Legal Considerations

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The **ADA** is a U.S. federal law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life. While the ADA does not explicitly mention websites, court rulings have interpreted it to apply to online spaces, especially for businesses and organizations that provide goods and services.

- Compliance: Websites should adhere to WCAG standards to meet ADA requirements.

- Liability: Failure to provide accessible websites can result in legal action.

##### INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) STANDARDS

International and national standards help ensure that ICT products and services are accessible.

- EN 301 549: A European standard outlining accessibility requirements for ICT products and services.

- Section 508: A U.S. federal law requiring government agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible.

### ISO Standards for Accessibility

- ISO/IEC 40500: Adoption of WCAG 2.0 as an international standard, providing global recognition of its principles.

- ISO 9241: Covers ergonomic requirements for interactive systems, including accessible user interfaces.

### Funding for Assistive Technology

The cost of assistive technology can vary widely, and several avenues may provide financial support:

- Charities and Foundations: Non-profit organizations may offer grants or funding for AT.

- Educational Institutions: Schools may fund AT for students as part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP).

- Employers: May provide AT as a reasonable accommodation under laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

- Government Programs: Social Security, veterans' benefits, or Medicaid may cover AT prescribed as medically necessary.

- Private Insurance: Health insurance may pay for AT devices recommended by a doctor.

- Rehabilitation Programs: Job training or vocational rehabilitation services may fund AT to support employment.

### Global Need for Assistive Technology

Despite the benefits, there is a significant global disparity in access to assistive technology:

- Barriers: High costs, limited product availability, insufficient funding, and lack of trained personnel.

- Global Initiatives: Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF are working to improve access to AT worldwide.

- Unmet Demand: Many individuals who need AT do not have access due to cost, lack of awareness, or inadequate policies.

#### Assistive Technology in Daily Life

Assistive technology plays a crucial role in the daily lives of individuals with disabilities, enabling them to perform tasks that might otherwise be challenging or impossible. Here are some examples of how AT is integrated into everyday activities:

- Communication: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices help individuals with speech impairments express themselves through text, symbols, or synthesized speech.
- Mobility: Wheelchairs, walkers, and prosthetics enhance physical mobility, allowing individuals to navigate their environments more easily.
- Daily Living Aids: Devices like adaptive utensils, medication reminders, and smart home technology assist with daily tasks, promoting independence and improving quality of life.

##### Assistive Technology in Education and Work

AT is widely used in educational settings to support students with disabilities:

- Math Tools: Calculators with large buttons or speech output aid in mathematical computations.

- Reading Assistance: Tools like audiobooks and TTS software help with reading comprehension.

- Writing Support: Speech recognition and word prediction software assist in writing tasks.

In the workplace, AT enables employees with disabilities to perform job tasks effectively:

- Communication Aids: Devices and software that facilitate communication for individuals with speech impairments.

- Ergonomic Equipment: Adjustable desks, specialized chairs, and adaptive keyboards.

- Task Management Software: Applications that help with organization and time management.

### Who and Unicef Global Report on Assistive Technology

The **Global Report on Assistive Technology** (2022) highlights the inequity in access to AT:

- Low-Income Countries: As few as 3% of people have access to the AT they need.

- High-Income Countries: Access can be as high as 90%.

- Recommendations: The report offers ten priority recommendations to enhance access to AT globally.
