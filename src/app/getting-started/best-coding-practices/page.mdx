# Best Coding Practices

## Table of Contents

Writing code isn't just about making it work; it's like crafting a fine dish. Your code should be clear, so others (and future you – future you will thank you) can understand it easily. It needs to be maintainable, which means it's simple to update and improve over time. And, of course, it has to be reliable!

## Write readable code

- **Use Descriptive and Meaningful Names**: Think of naming your variables and functions like naming a pet – calling your dog "Fluffy" is much clearer than "Dog123"! Meaningful names help others (and your future self) quickly understand what each part of the code does. Avoid using reserved words as variable names.

- **Organize Code with White Space**: White space can break up large blocks of code into logical sections, improving readability and making it easier to scan. Code that's too compact with operators and keywords is harder to follow. Ensure there are no spaces immediately after an opening parenthesis or before a closing parenthesis. However, always include a space after a comma when followed by a value, as this improves clarity.

- **Maintain Consistent Formatting**: Consistent indentation and formatting keep your code organized and easy to read for everyone involved. Since tabs and spaces may appear differently across development environments, it's important to decide on a standard at the start of a project – either tabs or spaces. If spaces are used, stick to either two or four spaces for indentation. Once the team agrees on a format, set up your editor to enforce these rules automatically.

## Follow coding standards

- **Adhere to Language-Specific Conventions**: Adhere to the established variable naming conventions, style guides, etc. for the programming language you're using. Following these conventions is crucial; it ensures your code remains consistent and significantly enhances readability for others.

- **Limit Line Length**: Keep your lines of code at a reasonable length, typically around 80 to 120 characters. This practice enhances readability and makes it easier to view and edit your code in various environments, preventing horizontal scrolling and improving overall code comprehension.

**NOTE**

A list of detailed language structure and conventions can be found in the Appendix at the end of the book for each of the languages the book goes through and touches on.

## Write modular code

- **Avoid Overcomplicating Code**: Strive to write efficient, straightforward code that addresses the problem without introducing unnecessary complexity. Simple code is easier to read, less prone to errors, and more maintainable over time. The "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle encourages developers to avoid convoluted solutions, ensuring clarity and functionality. Smaller, well-defined functions are easier to understand, test, and debug, ultimately leading to higher-quality code.

- **Prioritize Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand and follow, reducing confusion for others and for yourself when revisiting it later. Clear and readable code leads to fewer mistakes and easier maintenance.

- **Ensure Single Responsibility & Reusability**: Design each function to perform a single, clearly defined task. This promotes reusability and helps adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, preventing duplicated logic. Breaking code into smaller, modular functions also simplifies updates and testing, allowing team members to work independently without affecting the entire system.

## Use the DRY Principle

- **Refactor to Consolidate Similar Functionality**: Identify and eliminate repetitive code snippets. Regularly refactor your code to consolidate similar segments into reusable functions or modules. This practice not only de-clutters your codebase but also simplifies future updates, making them more manageable.

- **Reuse Code Instead of Duplicating It**: Why write the same thing twice when you can borrow from your own brilliance? Reusing existing code cuts down on redundancy and helps you avoid the pesky errors that come with duplicate code. Plus, it keeps your code looking sharp and tidy – like wearing the same favorite shirt every day, but in a good way!

## Document Your Code

- **Add Comments to Variable Definitions and Key Sections**: Use comments to explain complex logic or important parts of your code. However, avoid stating the obvious – there's no need to comment that a variable named firstName stores a first name! Focus on providing context where it's needed, like in tricky algorithms or when using less common practices.

- **Clarify Complex Logic**: Use comments to make confusing parts of your code more understandable. Instead of cluttering your code with redundant explanations, reserve comments for areas that really need clarity. For more in-depth documentation, use docstrings to describe functions, classes, or modules. Indent comments according to the code structure they're explaining. For inline comments, leave a space after the statement, followed by the comment. When using multiline comments, align the \* indentation and leave a blank line before and after the comment block.

- **Create Reader-Friendly README.md Files**: Your README.md file should provide a clear, concise summary of your project. This includes essential details like the project's purpose, installation steps, usage instructions, and any other necessary information. Make it easy to follow so that others can quickly understand and use your project.

- **Keep Documentation Up-to-Date**: As your code evolves, so should your documentation. Regularly review and update it to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of the project. This helps prevent confusion and keeps your documentation useful over time.
