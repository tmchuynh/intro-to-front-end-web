### HTML Templates

#### The `<template>` Tag: Your Hidden Gem in HTML

The `<template>` tag is like a magician's trick for web developers: it allows you to declare HTML that isn't rendered immediately on the page but can be activated whenever you need it. Think of it as a secret stash of code waiting for the right moment to shine!

#### What Does It Do?

- **Holds Markup**: The `<template>` tag can contain any HTML, including elements, attributes, and even JavaScript. However, this content isn't displayed when the page loads.

- **Improves Performance**: By keeping markup out of the initial DOM, you reduce the amount of HTML the browser has to parse on load, which can enhance performance, especially in complex applications.

- **Used for Client-Side Rendering**: You can dynamically clone and insert the content from the template into the document, making it great for **single-page applications** or **dynamic content loading**.

#### Key Features

- **No Immediate Rendering**: Content inside a `<template>` tag won't appear in the DOM until you programmatically insert it, keeping your initial load light and clean.

- **Reusable**: You can clone the template multiple times, making it easy to generate repeated UI elements without repeating code.

- **Supports Any HTML**: You can nest elements, use styles, and even include scripts inside the `<template>` tag (though the scripts won't execute until inserted into the DOM).

#### When to Use It

- **Avoiding Repetition**: If you find yourself copying and pasting the same HTML structure multiple times, consider using a `<template>` instead.

- **Dynamic Content**: When you need to generate UI components based on user interactions or data fetching.

- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: Perfect for rendering views without reloading the page.

    <script>
      const template = document.getElementById("todoTemplate");
      const todoList = document.getElementById("todoList");

      document.getElementById("addTodoButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
        const clone = document.importNode(template.content, true);
        todoList.appendChild(clone);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
