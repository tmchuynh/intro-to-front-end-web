## HTML

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is like the blueprint of a website—it's the "skeleton" that provides structure to everything online. Think of it as the scaffolding holding up all the content. It uses "tags," commands wrapped in angle brackets (like `<p>` for paragraphs or `<img>` for images), to tell your browser how to display each piece of content. Most tags come in pairs—a start tag (`<p>`) and an end tag (`</p>`). Just remember to use a forward slash (/) in closing tags; a backslash (\) in HTML is about as useful as a chocolate teapot!

HTML is pretty relaxed about capitalization, so `<IMG>`, `<img>`, and `<Img>` are all fine. However, **XHTML**, the stricter sibling, requires lowercase and properly closed tags—like attending a fancy event where every detail matters. HTML is more like a casual gathering where the rules are flexible, and no one cares if your shoes don't match!
