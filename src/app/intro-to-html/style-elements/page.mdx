#  Style Elements

HTML offers a handful of essential tags to style text but most of styling will be better done within stylesheets. Here's a list of some:

- `<b>` → makes text bold

- `<br>` → creates a line break

- `<s>` → displays a strikethrough in words

- `<hr>` → displays a horizontal rule

- `<i>` → italicizes text

- `<small>` → renders text in a smaller size, typically for fine print.

- `<sub>` → creates subscript text

- `<sup>` → creates superscript text

- `<u>` → underlines text

**NOTE**

Using HTML tags like `<br>`, `<small>`, or `<b>` for styling can lead to cluttered and outdated code. These tags mix content with presentation, making your HTML less flexible and harder to maintain. Instead, use CSS for styling to keep your structure clean and separation of concerns intact.

For example, instead of `<br>` to create space, use margin or padding in your CSS. This approach improves readability, scalability, and ensures your code adheres to modern web development standards.

    <h1>A Journey Through Time</h1>
    <p>
      On <time datetime="2023-09-21">September 21, 2023</time>, a young
      adventurer named <strong>Emily</strong> discovered an old book in her
      attic. The book was filled with stories of ancient civilizations and
      legends of hidden treasures.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      One story caught her eye: it mentioned the lost city of
      <abbr title="Atlantis">AT</abbr>. Legends claimed it was submerged under
      the sea and held treasures beyond imagination. <br />
      Determined to find it, Emily packed her bags, ready for the adventure of a
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she set sail, she recalled her grandmother's words:
      <q
        >Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the strength to move forward
        despite it.</q
      >
      <small><u>Grandma Joan</u></small>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Days turned into weeks, and just as she was about to lose hope, a storm
      hit. The waves crashed around her, but she remembered the glowing map she
      found in the book. It led her to a hidden island.
      <mark>Could this be the location of Atlantis?</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stepped onto the island, heart racing. <br />
      She knew this was just the beginning of her journey. With each step, she
      felt the thrill of the unknown, ready to uncover secrets long buried
      beneath the ocean's surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she explored, she marveled at the beauty around her and whispered to
      herself, <q>This is only the first chapter of my adventure.</q>
      <wbr />
