- [**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**](https://jwt.io/): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains information about the token type and signing algorithm, while the payload contains the claims (user information, permissions, etc.). The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token and ensure that it has not been tampered with. JWTs can be used for stateless authentication, allowing servers to verify user identities and permissions without maintaining session state. They are widely used in modern web applications and APIs for secure authentication and authorization.
