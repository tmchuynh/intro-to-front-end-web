# API Health

## Table of Contents

## Overview

API health refers to the overall performance, reliability, availability, and security of an Application Programming Interface (API). It encompasses various critical aspects including response times, error rates, uptime, throughput, and the ability to handle traffic spikes gracefully. Monitoring API health is essential for ensuring seamless user experiences, maintaining service reliability, and building trust with consumers of your API.

Modern distributed systems rely heavily on APIs for service-to-service communication, making API health monitoring a critical component of overall system observability. Container orchestration platforms can automatically scale API instances based on demand, ensuring high availability and performance. Technologies like Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and Google Cloud Run are commonly used for this purpose.

API health monitoring enables organizations to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact end users. A healthy API ensures that applications can access the data and services they need without interruptions, leading to better user experiences and higher customer satisfaction.

### Key Metrics for API Health

- **Response Time (Latency)**: The total time it takes for an API to process and respond to a request, typically measured in milliseconds. Includes network latency, processing time, and any downstream service calls.
- **Error Rate**: The percentage of requests that result in HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx status codes) within a given time period.
- **Uptime/Availability**: The percentage of time the API is operational and accessible, usually expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
- **Throughput (Requests Per Second)**: The number of requests the API can process successfully within a given time period, indicating its capacity.
- **Success Rate**: The percentage of requests that complete successfully (2xx status codes).
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: The time between sending a request and receiving the first byte of the response.
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage of the API infrastructure.
- **Dependency Health**: The health status of external services, databases, and third-party APIs that your API depends on.

## Health Check Types

### Liveness Checks
Determine if the API is running and responsive. These are basic checks that verify the service is alive and can accept requests.

### Readiness Checks  
Verify that the API is ready to serve traffic. This includes checking database connections, external service dependencies, and resource availability.

### Deep Health Checks
Comprehensive checks that validate the entire system including:
- Database connectivity and query performance
- External API dependencies
- Cache availability
- File system access
- Configuration validity

## SLA vs SLO vs SLI

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
Quantitative measurements of service performance:
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Availability percentages
- Throughput metrics

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Target values for SLIs that define acceptable service performance:
- "99.9% of requests should complete within 200ms"
- "Error rate should be less than 0.1%"
- "API should be available 99.95% of the time"

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Contractual commitments to customers based on SLOs, including consequences for not meeting targets:
- Uptime guarantees with penalty clauses
- Response time commitments
- Support response times

## API Health Monitoring Strategies

### Synthetic Monitoring
Proactive monitoring using automated scripts that simulate user interactions:
- Scheduled API calls from multiple locations
- End-to-end transaction testing
- Critical path validation

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
Monitoring actual user interactions with the API:
- Tracking real request/response patterns
- Identifying user-specific performance issues
- Geographic performance analysis

### Distributed Tracing
Following requests across multiple services:
- Request flow visualization
- Bottleneck identification
- Cross-service dependency mapping

### Log-based Monitoring
Analyzing API logs for health insights:
- Error pattern detection
- Performance trend analysis
- Security event monitoring

## Common API Health Issues

### Performance Degradation
- **Slow Database Queries**: Unoptimized queries causing high response times
- **Memory Leaks**: Gradually increasing memory usage leading to performance issues
- **Resource Contention**: Competition for CPU, memory, or network resources

### Availability Issues
- **Service Outages**: Complete service failures due to infrastructure problems
- **Dependency Failures**: External service failures affecting your API
- **Network Connectivity**: DNS issues, network partitions, or routing problems

### Error Patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: APIs hitting configured rate limits
- **Authentication Failures**: Issues with API keys, tokens, or certificates
- **Data Validation Errors**: Malformed requests or data type mismatches

### Scalability Problems
- **Traffic Spikes**: Sudden increases in request volume
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Running out of connection pools, file descriptors, or memory
- **Cascade Failures**: One service failure triggering failures in dependent services
