   - Folder: Optional subfolder organization
5. **Save the request** for future use

**Request Organization Tips**:

- Use consistent naming conventions: `[METHOD] [Resource] - [Action]`
- Group by functionality: Authentication, CRUD operations, etc.
- Add descriptions: Document expected behavior and use cases
- Use folders: Create logical groupings within collections
- Color coding: Use status indicators for different request types

**Advanced Collection Features**:

```javascript title="Collection-level Scripts"
// Collection-level Pre-request Script
pm.environment.set("timestamp", new Date().toISOString());
pm.environment.set("requestId", pm.variables.replaceIn("{{$randomUUID}}"));

// Collection-level Test Script
pm.test("Response time is less than 500ms", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});

pm.test("Status code is successful", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.be.oneOf([200, 201, 202, 204]);
});
```

### Environment Variables and Configuration

#### Creating and Managing Environments

Environment variables allow you to store reusable values and switch between different API configurations (development, staging, production).

**Setting Up Environments**:

1. **Click on the** <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">Environments</Button> **tab**
2. **Create a new environment** with <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">New Environment</Button>
3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Variable Name: Descriptive key name
   - Current Value: The actual value to use
   - Initial Value: Default/shared value for team members
4. **Activate the environment** to use its variables

**Environment Examples**:

##### Development Environment

```json title="Development Environment"
{
  "name": "Development",
  "variables": [
    {
      "key": "baseURL",
      "value": "https://api-dev.example.com"
    },
    {
      "key": "apiKey",
      "value": "dev_sk_123456789"
    },
    {
      "key": "timeout",
      "value": "5000"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Production Environment

```json title="Production Environment"
{
  "name": "Production",
  "variables": [
    {
      "key": "baseURL",
      "value": "https://api.example.com"
    },
    {
      "key": "apiKey",
      "value": "prod_sk_987654321"
    },
    {
      "key": "timeout",
      "value": "3000"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Using Environment Variables

**In Request URLs**:

```bash
GET {{baseURL}}/api/v1/products
{{baseURL}}/api/v1/users
{{baseURL}}/products/{{productId}}
```

**In Headers**:

```http
Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}
X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**In Request Bodies**:

```json
{
  "userId": "{{currentUserId}}",
  "timestamp": "{{$timestamp}}",
  "environment": "{{env}}"
}
```

##### Secret Management

**Handling Sensitive Data**:

- Use "Current Value" for sensitive data (not shared with team)
- Use "Initial Value" for non-sensitive defaults
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use workspace-level secrets for team-shared sensitive data

**Secret Variable Examples**:

```json
{
  "variables": [
    {
      "key": "publicApiKey",
      "initialValue": "pk_test_...",
      "currentValue": "pk_live_..."
    },
    {
      "key": "privateApiKey",
      "initialValue": "",
      "currentValue": "sk_live_..." // Only stored locally
    }
  ]
}
```

    "email": "john@example.com"
  }'
```

##### Pre-request Scripts and Post-response Tests

Hoppscotch supports JavaScript scripting for dynamic request preparation and response validation.

**Pre-request Script Examples**:

```javascript
// Set dynamic timestamp
pm.environment.set("timestamp", new Date().toISOString());

// Generate random data
pm.environment.set(
  "randomEmail",
  `user${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}@example.com`,
);

// Calculate signature for API authentication
const message = pm.request.url.toString() + pm.environment.get("timestamp");
const signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(
  message,
  pm.environment.get("secretKey"),
).toString();
pm.environment.set("signature", signature);

// Conditional logic based on environment
if (pm.environment.get("env") === "production") {
  pm.request.headers.add({
    key: "X-Environment",
    value: "production",
  });
}
```

**Post-response Test Examples**:

```javascript
// Basic response validation
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is less than 500ms", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});

// JSON schema validation
pm.test("Response has correct structure", function () {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(jsonData).to.have.property("id");
  pm.expect(jsonData).to.have.property("name");
  pm.expect(jsonData.email).to.match(/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/);
});

// Extract data for next request
pm.test("Extract user ID", function () {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.environment.set("userId", jsonData.id);
});

// Conditional testing
pm.test("Admin user has additional permissions", function () {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  if (jsonData.role === "admin") {
    pm.expect(jsonData.permissions).to.include("admin_access");
  }
});
```

##### Request History and Favorites

**Request History Features**:

- Automatic tracking of all sent requests
- Search and filter through request history

### Collection Runners and Automation

#### Running Collections

Collection runners enable automated execution of multiple requests in sequence, perfect for testing workflows and API validation.

**Setting Up Collection Runs**:

1. **Navigate to the** <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">Collections</Button> **panel**
2. **Click the run button** next to your collection
3. **Configure run settings**:
   - Environment selection
   - Delay between requests (in milliseconds)
   - Number of iterations
   - Data file for parameterized testing
4. **Start the collection run** and monitor progress

**Collection Run Configuration**:

```
 Run Configuration:
   Environment: Production
   Delay: 1000ms between requests
   Iterations: 5 runs
   Data Source: test-data.csv
   Test Results: Real-time display
   Performance Metrics: Response times, success rates
```

**Collection Run Results**:

```
 Collection Run Summary
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Collection: E-commerce API Test Suite   │
│ Total Requests: 25                      │
│ Successful: 23 (92%)                    │
│ Failed: 2 (8%)                          │
│ Average Response Time: 245ms            │
│ Total Duration: 00:02:15                │
   ───────────────────────────────────────┘

Request Details:
 POST /auth/login (200ms) -  All tests passed
 GET /products (150ms) -  All tests passed
 POST /orders (timeout) -  Request timeout
 GET /orders/123 (180ms) -  All tests passed
```

##### Data-Driven Testing

Use external data sources to run the same collection with different input parameters.

**CSV Data File Example (test-data.csv)**:

```csv
username,email,expectedStatus,testCase
john_doe,john@example.com,201,Valid user creation
jane_smith,jane@example.com,201,Another valid user
invalid_user,not-an-email,400,Invalid email format
duplicate_user,john@example.com,409,Duplicate email
admin_user,admin@example.com,201,Admin user creation
```

**Using Data Variables in Requests**:

```json
{
  "username": "{{username}}",
  "email": "{{email}}",
  "password": "defaultPassword123",
  "role": "user"
}
```

**Data-driven Test Script**:

```javascript
pm.test("Status code matches expected", function () {
  const expectedStatus = parseInt(pm.iterationData.get("expectedStatus"));
  pm.response.to.have.status(expectedStatus);
});

pm.test("Test case: " + pm.iterationData.get("testCase"), function () {
  const responseJson = pm.response.json();

  if (pm.iterationData.get("expectedStatus") === "201") {
    pm.expect(responseJson).to.have.property("id");
    pm.expect(responseJson.email).to.eql(pm.iterationData.get("email"));
  }
});
```

##### Monitoring and Scheduling

**API Monitoring Features**:

- Scheduled collection runs at specified intervals
- Health check monitoring for critical endpoints
