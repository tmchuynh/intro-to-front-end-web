## Getting Started

Hoppscotch offers [Hoppscotch Web App](https://hoppscotch.io/) for immediate use, which is a web-based version that requires no installation, [Hoppscotch Desktop App](https://hoppscotch.com/download) for offline use, and [Hoppscotch CLI](https://docs.hoppscotch.io/documentation/clients/cli/overview) for command-line interface usage. The web app is the most convenient way to start using Hoppscotch, as it provides a fully functional API testing environment right in your browser.

You can also self-host by using either the community edition or the enterprise edition. The community edition is free and open-source, while the enterprise edition offers additional features and support.
