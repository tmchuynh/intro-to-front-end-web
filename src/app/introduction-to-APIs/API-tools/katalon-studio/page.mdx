- For example, you can use `WS.sendRequest()` to send an API request and `WS.verifyResponseStatusCode()` to validate the response status code

#### Using Data-Driven Testing

Data-driven testing in Katalon Studio allows you to run the same test case with multiple sets of input data. This is useful for testing different scenarios without duplicating test cases.

- Create a data file (CSV, Excel, or database) containing the input data
- In the test case editor, click on the **Data Binding** tab
- Select the data file and map the columns to the variables in your test case
- Use the Data Binding feature to parameterize your test case with data from external sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)

```groovy
// Example of using data-driven testing with a CSV file
import com.kms.katalon.core.testdata.TestDataFactory as TestDataFactory
TestData data = TestDataFactory.findTestData('Data Files/YourDataFile')
for (int i = 1; i <= data.getRowNumbers(); i++) {
    String name = data.getValue('Name', i)
    String email = data.getValue('Email', i)

    // Use the variables in your API request
    WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/YourTestObject', [('name') : name, ('email') : email]))
}
```
