- Write your Groovy code to perform the desired actions, such as sending API requests, parsing responses, or validating data
- You can use Katalon Studio's built-in keywords and methods to interact with the API and perform assertions
- For example, you can use `WS.sendRequest()` to send an API request and `WS.verifyResponseStatusCode()` to validate the response status code

##### Using Data-Driven Testing

Data-driven testing in Katalon Studio allows you to run the same test case with multiple sets of input data. This is useful for testing different scenarios without duplicating test cases.

- Create a data file (CSV, Excel, or database) containing the input data
- In the test case editor, click on the **Data Binding** tab
- Select the data file and map the columns to the variables in your test case
- Use the Data Binding feature to parameterize your test case with data from external sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)

```groovy
// Example of using data-driven testing with a CSV file
import com.kms.katalon.core.testdata.TestDataFactory as TestDataFactory
TestData data = TestDataFactory.findTestData('Data Files/YourDataFile')
for (int i = 1; i <= data.getRowNumbers(); i++) {
    String name = data.getValue('Name', i)
    String email = data.getValue('Email', i)

    // Use the variables in your API request
    WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/YourTestObject', [('name') : name, ('email') : email]))
}
```

### Test Design Patterns and Strategies

##### Page Object Model for APIs

```groovy
// API Page Object Pattern
class UserAPI {
    static String baseEndpoint = "${GlobalVariable.apiBaseUrl}/api/v1/users"

    static def create(Map userData) {
        def request = findTestObject('API/Users/Create')
        request.setRequestBody(userData)
        return WS.sendRequest(request)
    }

    static def getById(String userId) {
        return WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/Users/GetById', [
            ('userId'): userId
        ]))
    }

    static def update(String userId, Map updateData) {
        return WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/Users/Update', [
            ('userId'): userId,
            ('requestBody'): updateData
        ]))
    }

    static def delete(String userId) {
        return WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/Users/Delete', [
            ('userId'): userId
        ]))
    }

    static def search(Map searchCriteria) {
        def queryParams = searchCriteria.collect { k, v -> "${k}=${v}" }.join('&')
        return WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/Users/Search', [
            ('queryParams'): queryParams
        ]))
    }
}

// Usage in test cases
def newUser = [name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com']
def createResponse = UserAPI.create(newUser)
def userId = new JsonSlurper().parseText(createResponse.getResponseBodyContent()).id
def getResponse = UserAPI.getById(userId)
```

##### Builder Pattern for Test Data

```groovy
class UserBuilder {
    private Map userData = [:]

    static UserBuilder create() {
        return new UserBuilder()
    }

    UserBuilder withName(String name) {
        userData.name = name
        return this
    }

    UserBuilder withEmail(String email) {
        userData.email = email
        return this
    }

    UserBuilder withAddress(String street, String city, String zipcode) {
        userData.address = [
            street: street,
            city: city,
            zipcode: zipcode
        ]
        return this
    }

    UserBuilder withRole(String role) {
        userData.role = role
        return this
    }

    UserBuilder withRandomData() {
        userData.name = Faker.instance().name().fullName()
        userData.email = Faker.instance().internet().emailAddress()
        userData.phone = Faker.instance().phoneNumber().phoneNumber()
        return this
    }

    Map build() {
        return userData.clone()
    }
}

// Usage
def adminUser = UserBuilder.create()
    .withName('Admin User')
    .withEmail('admin@company.com')
    .withRole('administrator')
    .build()

def randomUser = UserBuilder.create()
    .withRandomData()
    .withRole('user')
    .build()

### Security and Performance Testing

##### Security Testing Patterns

```groovy
class SecurityTestPatterns {

    static List<String> sqlInjectionPayloads = [
        "' OR '1'='1",
        "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
        "' UNION SELECT * FROM users --",
        "admin'--",
        "admin'/*",
        "' OR 1=1#",
        "') OR ('1'='1"
    ]

    static void testSQLInjection(String endpoint, String parameter) {
        sqlInjectionPayloads.each { payload ->
            try {
                def response = WS.sendRequest(findTestObject(endpoint, [
                    (parameter): payload
                ]))

                // Check for SQL injection indicators
                def responseBody = response.getResponseBodyContent().toLowerCase()

                if (responseBody.contains('sql') ||
                    responseBody.contains('syntax error') ||
                    responseBody.contains('mysql') ||
                    responseBody.contains('postgresql')) {

                    throw new AssertionError("Potential SQL injection vulnerability detected with payload: ${payload}")
                }

            } catch (Exception e) {
                println "Testing payload: ${payload} - Result: ${e.message}"
            }
        }
    }

    static void testAuthenticationBypass() {
        def bypassPayloads = [
            ['Authorization': ''],
            ['Authorization': 'Bearer invalid_token'],
            ['Authorization': 'Bearer ' + 'a' * 1000], // Long token
            ['X-Forwarded-For': '127.0.0.1'],
            ['X-Real-IP': '127.0.0.1']
        ]

        bypassPayloads.each { headers ->
            def response = WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/Protected/Resource', [
                ('customHeaders'): headers
            ]))

            // Should return 401/403, not 200
            if (WS.getResponseStatusCode(response) == 200) {
                throw new AssertionError("Authentication bypass possible with headers: ${headers}")
            }
        }
    }
}

##### Performance Testing

```groovy
import java.util.concurrent.*
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger

class APIPerformanceTest {

    static void loadTest(String testName, Closure testLogic, int userCount, int duration) {
        def executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(userCount)
        def successCount = new AtomicInteger(0)
        def failureCount = new AtomicInteger(0)
        def responseTimes = Collections.synchronizedList([])

        def startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
        def endTime = startTime + (duration * 1000)

        println "Starting load test: ${testName}"
        println "Users: ${userCount}, Duration: ${duration}s"

        for (int i = 0; i < userCount; i++) {
            executor.submit {
                while (System.currentTimeMillis() < endTime) {
                    def requestStart = System.currentTimeMillis()
                    try {
                        testLogic.call()
                        def responseTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - requestStart
                        responseTimes.add(responseTime)
                        successCount.incrementAndGet()
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        failureCount.incrementAndGet()
                        println "Request failed: ${e.message}"
                    }

                    Thread.sleep(100) // Think time
                }
            }
        }

        executor.shutdown()
        executor.awaitTermination(duration + 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

        // Calculate statistics
        def totalRequests = successCount.get() + failureCount.get()
        def avgResponseTime = responseTimes.sum() / responseTimes.size()
        def minResponseTime = responseTimes.min()
        def maxResponseTime = responseTimes.max()
        def throughput = totalRequests / duration

        println "\n=== Load Test Results ==="
        println "Total Requests: ${totalRequests}"
        println "Successful: ${successCount.get()}"
        println "Failed: ${failureCount.get()}"
        println "Success Rate: ${(successCount.get() / totalRequests * 100).round(2)}%"
        println "Average Response Time: ${avgResponseTime.round(2)}ms"
        println "Min Response Time: ${minResponseTime}ms"
        println "Max Response Time: ${maxResponseTime}ms"
        println "Throughput: ${throughput.round(2)} requests/second"
    }
}

// Usage
APIPerformanceTest.loadTest("User API Load Test", {
    def response = UserAPI.getById('123')
    WS.verifyResponseStatusCode(response, 200)
}, 10, 60) // 10 users for 60 seconds

### Maintenance and Quality Guidelines

##### Code Review Checklist

- **Test Object Management**
  - Are test objects properly named and organized?
  - Are endpoints parameterized for reusability?
  - Are authentication headers properly configured?

- **Test Data Management**
  - Is test data externalized and environment-specific?
  - Are sensitive data properly secured?
  - Is test data cleanup implemented?

- **Assertion Quality**
  - Are assertions and meaningful?
  - Is response schema validation implemented?
  - Are error scenarios properly tested?

- **Maintainability**
  - Are custom keywords documented?
  - Is test code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
  - Are magic numbers and strings avoided?

##### Continuous Improvement Practices

```groovy
// Regular test health checks
class TestHealthMonitor {

    static void analyzeTestStability() {
        def testResults = getRecentTestResults(30) // Last 30 days

        testResults.groupBy { it.testName }.each { testName, results ->
            def failureRate = results.count { it.status == 'FAILED' } / results.size()
            def avgResponseTime = results.collect { it.responseTime }.sum() / results.size()

            if (failureRate > 0.1) { // More than 10% failure rate
                println "⚠️  Flaky test detected: ${testName} (${failureRate * 100}% failure rate)"
            }

            if (avgResponseTime > 5000) { // Slower than 5 seconds
                println "🐌 Slow test detected: ${testName} (${avgResponseTime}ms avg)"
            }
        }
    }

    static void generateCoverageReport() {
        def endpoints = getAllAPIEndpoints()
        def testedEndpoints = getTestedEndpoints()

        def coverage = (testedEndpoints.size() / endpoints.size()) * 100
        println "API Test Coverage: ${coverage.round(2)}%"

        def untestedEndpoints = endpoints - testedEndpoints
        if (untestedEndpoints) {
            println "Untested endpoints:"
            untestedEndpoints.each { println "  - ${it}" }
        }
    }
}
