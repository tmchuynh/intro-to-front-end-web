# Mockoon

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Mockoon is a widely used open-source API mocking tool, originally developed by Guillaume Monnet in 2017. It enables developers to quickly simulate REST APIs, allowing for rapid development and testing without depending on live third-party servicesâ€”which are often unreliable, slow, or costly during early-stage development and QA workflows. Mockoon is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and ideal for creating mock endpoints that behave like real APIs, making it a valuable tool in modern API-driven development environments.

## Using Mockoon

### Creating a Mock API

- **Open Mockoon**: Launch the Mockoon application on your machine.
- **Create a New Environment**: Click on the <Button variant="tertiary" className="mx-1">New Environment</Button> button to create a new mock API environment.
- **Add Endpoints**: Click on the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Add Endpoint</Button> button to create a new endpoint. You can specify the HTTP method, path, and response details.
- **Define Responses**: For each endpoint, you can define the response status code, headers, and body content. Mockoon allows you to use JSON, XML, or plain text for the response body.
- **Start the Mock Server**: Once you have defined your endpoints, click on the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Start</Button> button to run the mock server. You can access your mock API at the specified port (default is 3000).

### Testing the Mock API

- **Use a REST Client**: You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or even your browser to test the mock API endpoints.
- **Send Requests**: Send HTTP requests to the mock API endpoints you created. Mockoon will respond with the predefined responses you set up for each endpoint.
- **Inspect Responses**: Check the responses returned by the mock API to ensure they match your expectations. You can also modify the responses in Mockoon and restart the server to see the changes.

### Managing Environments

- **Switching Environments**: Mockoon allows you to create multiple environments for different mock APIs. You can switch between environments using the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the application.
- **Exporting/Importing Environments**: You can export your mock API configurations as JSON files for backup or sharing. To export, click on the <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">Export</Button> button. To import an environment, click on the <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">Import</Button> button and select the JSON file you want to import.

#### Organizing Endpoints

- **Grouping Endpoints**: You can organize your endpoints into groups for better management. Click on the <Button variant="secondary" className="mx-1">Add Group</Button> button to create a new group, and then drag and drop endpoints into the group.
- **Editing Endpoints**: To edit an endpoint, click on it in the left sidebar. You can change the HTTP method, path, response status code, headers, and body content. After making changes, click on the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Save</Button> button to apply the changes.
- **Deleting Endpoints**: To delete an endpoint, right-click on it in the left sidebar and select <Button variant="danger" className="mx-1">Delete</Button>. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

## Using Mockoon Web

Mockoon Web is a browser-based version of Mockoon that allows you to create and manage mock APIs without installing any software. It provides a similar interface to the desktop application, making it easy to get started with mocking APIs quickly.

### Creating a Mock API in Mockoon Web

- **Create a New Environment**: Click on the <Button variant="tertiary" className="mx-1">New Environment</Button> button to create a new mock API environment.
- **Add Endpoints**: Click on the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Add Endpoint</Button> button to create a new endpoint. You can specify the HTTP method, path, and response details.
- **Define Responses**: For each endpoint, you can define the response status code, headers, and body content. Mockoon Web allows you to use JSON, XML, or plain text for the response body.
- **Start the Mock Server**: Once you have defined your endpoints, click on the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Start</Button> button to run the mock server. You can access your mock API at the specified port (default is 3000).

## Using Mockoon CLI

Mockoon CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to run mock servers and automate tasks related to mocking APIs. It is particularly useful for integrating mock APIs into CI/CD pipelines or running tests in automated environments.

### Installing Mockoon CLI

To install Mockoon CLI, you can use npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g mockoon-cli
```

### Running a Mock Server with Mockoon CLI

Once you have installed Mockoon CLI, you can run a mock server using the following command:

```bash
mockoon-cli start --data <path-to-your-mock-data-file.json> --port <port-number>
```

Replace `<path-to-your-mock-data-file.json>` with the path to your mock API configuration file and `<port-number>` with the desired port number (default is 3000).

### Automating Tasks with Mockoon CLI

Mockoon CLI allows you to automate tasks such as starting and stopping mock servers, importing/exporting mock API configurations, and running tests against mock APIs. You can create scripts to streamline your development and testing workflows.
