| **Response Time**    | Time taken to receive the response                   | Next to the status code                       |
| **Response Size**    | Size of the response in bytes                        | Next to the response time                     |
| **Response Body**    | The actual data returned by the API                  | In the response body section                  |
| **Response Headers** | Metadata about the response (e.g., content type)     | In the headers tab of the response panel      |
| **Cookies**          | Cookies set by the server                            | In the cookies tab of the response panel      |
| **Test Results**     | Results of any tests run on the response             | In the test results tab of the response panel |

#### Writing Tests

Writing tests in Postman allows you to automate the validation of API responses. You can use the built-in Postman Sandbox, which provides a JavaScript environment to write tests that run after a request is sent.
You can access the response data using `pm.response` and write assertions to check if the response meets your expectations. Postman provides a rich set of assertion methods to validate various aspects of the response, such as status codes, response time, and specific data fields.

- Navigate to the **Tests** tab
- Write JavaScript code to validate response data

```javascript
// Example test script
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response has required fields", function () {
  const responseData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(responseData).to.have.property("id");
  pm.expect(responseData).to.have.property("name");
});
```

#### Using Environment Variables

Postman allows you to define environment variables to manage different configurations (e.g., development, staging, production). Environment variables can be used to store API keys, base URLs, and other dynamic values that may change between environments.

- Create a new environment in Postman
- Define variables under **Manage Environments**
- Reference variables in requests using `{{variableName}}`

```javascript
// Example using environment variables
const apiUrl = pm.environment.get("apiUrl");
const apiKey = pm.environment.get("apiKey");

pm.request.headers.add({
  key: "Authorization",
  value: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
});
```

#### Automating Testing

A collection runner is a feature in Postman that allows you to run a collection of requests with different sets of data. You can use it to automate testing by providing a data file (CSV or JSON) that contains multiple sets of input values for your requests.

- Use the **Collection Runner** to:
  - Execute multiple requests in sequence
  - Run test suites
  - Generate test reports
- Set up data files for parameterized testing

**TIP**

> When working with sensitive data like API keys or passwords, always use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your requests. This practice enhances security and makes it easier to switch between different environments.

- Enter the test case name and description
- Click <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Ok</Button> to create the test case

#### Setting Up the Test Case

- In the test case editor, you can add steps to define the API request
- Use the <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Add</Button> button to insert steps such as:
  - **Send Request**: Configure the HTTP method, URL, headers, and body
  - **Verify Response**: Add assertions to validate the response status code, headers, and body content
- Use the **Data Binding** feature to parameterize your test case with data from external sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)

#### Writing Assertions

Assertions in Katalon Studio allow you to validate the expected outcomes of your API requests. You can use built-in keywords or write custom Groovy scripts to perform assertions on the response data.

- Use the `Verify` keyword to check the response status code, headers, and body content

```groovy
// Example assertion to verify the response status code
import static com.kms.katalon.core.testobject.ObjectRepository.findTestObject
import com.kms.katalon.core.webservice.keyword.WSBuiltInKeywords as WS
WS.verifyResponseStatusCode(findTestObject('API/YourTestObject'), 200)
// Example assertion to verify a specific field in the response body
WS.verifyElementPropertyValue(findTestObject('API/YourTestObject'), 'data.id', 12345)
```

#### Running the Test Case

- Click on the <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Run</Button> button in the toolbar to execute the test case
- Katalon Studio will execute the API request and display the results in the **Log Viewer**
- Review the execution logs to see the status of each step and any assertions that failed

#### Using Data-Driven Testing

Data-driven testing in Katalon Studio allows you to run the same test case with multiple sets of input data. This is useful for testing different scenarios without duplicating test cases.

- Create a data file (CSV, Excel, or database) containing the input data
- In the test case editor, click on the **Data Binding** tab
- Select the data file and map the columns to the variables in your test case
- Use the Data Binding feature to parameterize your test case with data from external sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)

```groovy
// Example of using data-driven testing with a CSV file
import com.kms.katalon.core.testdata.TestDataFactory as TestDataFactory
TestData data = TestDataFactory.findTestData('Data Files/YourDataFile')
for (int i = 1; i <= data.getRowNumbers(); i++) {
    String name = data.getValue('Name', i)
    String email = data.getValue('Email', i)

    // Use the variables in your API request
    WS.sendRequest(findTestObject('API/YourTestObject', [('name') : name, ('email') : email]))
}
```

### Using Swagger UI: A Practical Guide #### Setting Up Swagger UI To use
Swagger UI, you need to have an OpenAPI specification file (in JSON or YAML
format) that describes your API endpoints, request/response formats, and
authentication methods. You can either create this file manually or use tools
like Swagger Editor to generate it. - Download the Swagger UI distribution from
the [Swagger UI GitHub repository]() - Extract the contents of the downloaded
ZIP file to a directory on your web server - Place your OpenAPI specification
file (e.g., `swagger.json` or `swagger.yaml`) in the same directory - Open the
`index.html` file in a web browser - Modify the `url` parameter in the
`index.html` file to point to your OpenAPI specification file

```html
<script>
  const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
    url: "swagger.json", // Path to your OpenAPI specification file
    dom_id: "#swagger-ui",
    deepLinking: true,
    presets: [SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis, SwaggerUIStandalonePreset],
    layout: "StandaloneLayout",
  });
  window.ui = ui;
</script>
```

#### Exploring API Endpoints

Once Swagger UI is set up, you can start exploring your API endpoints:

- Open the Swagger UI in your web browser
- You will see a list of available API endpoints organized by tags
- Click on an endpoint to expand its details, including the HTTP method, request parameters, and response formats
- You can view the request and response examples, including headers and body content

#### Testing API Endpoints

Swagger UI allows you to test API endpoints directly from the documentation interface:

- Click on the <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Try it out</Button> button for the desired endpoint
- Enter any required parameters in the input fields provided
- Click on the <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Execute</Button> button to send the request
- Swagger UI will display the response status code, headers, and body content in the response section
- You can also view the curl command for the request, which can be useful for testing in a terminal or command line

```bash
# Example curl command generated by Swagger UI
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/users" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization= Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Customizing Swagger UI

Swagger UI provides several options for customization to match your branding and design requirements:

- You can modify the `index.html` file to change the title, description, and other metadata
- You can customize the CSS styles by modifying the `swagger-ui.css` file or adding your own styles
- You can add custom JavaScript to extend the functionality of Swagger UI or integrate it with other tools

#### Integrating Swagger UI with Your Application

Swagger UI can be easily integrated into your existing web applications or documentation sites:

- You can embed Swagger UI as an iframe in your application by pointing the `src` attribute to the URL of your Swagger UI instance

```html
<iframe
  src="https://yourdomain.com/swagger-ui/index.html"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
></iframe>
```

- You can also use Swagger UI as a standalone application by hosting it on a separate subdomain or path
- If you're using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js, you can integrate Swagger UI as a component or module in your application
