# Postman

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a comprehensive API development platform that simplifies and accelerates the process of building, testing, and managing APIs. It provides a powerful, user-friendly interface that allows developers to craft HTTP requests, inspect responses in detail, and automate testing workflowsâ€”all without writing extensive code upfront. Postman supports every stage of the API lifecycle, making it a go-to solution for backend developers, frontend engineers, QA testers, and DevOps teams alike.

With Postman, you can organize API requests into collections, define and manage environment variables for different development stages, and write custom test scripts in JavaScript to validate responses. Its ability to mock endpoints, monitor API performance, and automatically generate documentation makes it invaluable for both rapid prototyping and long-term maintenance of APIs.

Additionally, Postman fosters collaboration through shared workspaces, version control, and team-based access management. Whether you're debugging a single endpoint or managing a large-scale microservices architecture, Postman offers the flexibility and scalability to support modern, API-first development workflows.

### Authentication

Postman supports various authentication methods to secure API requests. You can configure authentication settings for each request or globally for a collection.

- Navigate to the **Authorization** tab
- Select authentication type and provide necessary credentials:

| Type              | Description                                                  |

| **API Key**       | Use an API key in headers or query parameters                |
| **Bearer Token**  | Use a token in the Authorization header                      |
| **Basic Auth**    | Use username and password for basic authentication           |
| **OAuth 2.0**     | Use OAuth 2.0 for secure access to protected resources       |
| **Digest Auth**   | Use digest authentication for secure access                  |
| **AWS Signature** | Use AWS signature for authenticated requests to AWS services |
| **NTLM**          | Use NTLM authentication for Windows-based services           |
| **Hawk**          | Use Hawk authentication for secure API requests              |
| **Custom**        | Use custom authentication methods as needed                  |
| **OAuth 1.0**     | Use OAuth 1.0 for secure access to protected resources       |

**RESOURCE**

> The authentication method you choose will depend on the API you are working with. Always refer to the API documentation for the required authentication method and credentials. More about authentication can be found in the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/).

### Sending Requests

- Click <Button variant="outline" className="mx-1">Send</Button> to execute
- Things to take note of:

| Field                | Description                                          | Location in UI                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Status Code**      | HTTP response status code (e.g., 200, 404)           | Next to the response body                     |
| **Status Message**   | Description of the status code (e.g., OK, Not Found) | Next to the status code                       |
| **Response Time**    | Time taken to receive the response                   | Next to the status code                       |
| **Response Size**    | Size of the response in bytes                        | Next to the response time                     |
| **Response Body**    | The actual data returned by the API                  | In the response body section                  |
| **Response Headers** | Metadata about the response (e.g., content type)     | In the headers tab of the response panel      |
| **Cookies**          | Cookies set by the server                            | In the cookies tab of the response panel      |
| **Test Results**     | Results of any tests run on the response             | In the test results tab of the response panel |

<BackToTop />

### Writing Tests

Writing tests in Postman allows you to automate the validation of API responses. You can use the built-in Postman Sandbox, which provides a JavaScript environment to write tests that run after a request is sent.
You can access the response data using `pm.response` and write assertions to check if the response meets your expectations. Postman provides a rich set of assertion methods to validate various aspects of the response, such as status codes, response time, and specific data fields.

- Navigate to the **Tests** tab
- Write JavaScript code to validate response data

```javascript
// Example test script
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response has required fields", function () {
  const responseData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(responseData).to.have.property("id");
  pm.expect(responseData).to.have.property("name");
});
```

### Using Environment Variables

**Postman Vault** allows you to manage environment variables, which are key-value pairs that can be used across requests and collections. Environment variables are useful for storing configuration settings, such as API keys, base URLs, and other parameters that may change between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

- Create a new environment by clicking on the **Environments** icon in the left sidebar
- Click on the **+** icon to create a new environment
- Enter the environment name and add key-value pairs for variables
- Click <Button variant="tertiary" className="mx-1">Save</Button> to create the environment
- To use an environment variable in a request, reference it using the `{{variableName}}` syntax

```javascript
// Example of using an environment variable in a request URL
const baseUrl = pm.environment.get("baseUrl");
pm.request.url = `${baseUrl}/api/users`;
```

### Automating Testing

A collection runner is a feature in Postman that allows you to run a collection of requests with different sets of data. You can use it to automate testing by providing a data file (CSV or JSON) that contains multiple sets of input values for your requests.

- Use the **Collection Runner** to:
  - Execute multiple requests in sequence
  - Run test suites
  - Generate test reports
- Set up data files for parameterized testing

**TIP**

> When working with sensitive data like API keys or passwords, always use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your requests. This practice enhances security and makes it easier to switch between different environments.
