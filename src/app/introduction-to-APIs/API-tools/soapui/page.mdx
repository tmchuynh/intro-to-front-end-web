## Getting Started

SoapUI is available in both open-source and commercial versions, called [ReadyAPI](<(https://www.soapui.org/downloads/download-readyapi-trial/)>). You can download the open-source version from the [SoapUI website](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui-open-source/).

### Is Open Source Right for You?

SoapUI's open-source version is suitable for individual developers and small teams who need basic API testing capabilities. If you require advanced features like enterprise-level support, security testing, or load testing, consider the commercial version, SoapUI Pro.

## Using SoapUI

### Creating a Request

- Open SoapUI and create a new project.
- Right-click on the project and select "New SOAP Request" or "New REST Request."
- Enter the endpoint URL and select the request method (GET, POST, etc.).
- Add headers, parameters, and body content as needed.

#### Organizing Requests

- Use folders to organize requests within the project.
- Right-click on the project and select "New Folder" to create a new folder.
- Drag and drop requests into the appropriate folders for better organization.

### Sending Requests

- Click the <Button variant="primary" className="mx-1">Send</Button> button to send the request.
- View the response in the response panel, which displays status codes, headers, and body content.
- Use the "Raw" tab to view the raw request and response data.

### Adding Parameters and Headers

- Use the "Headers" tab to add custom headers to your request.
- Use the "Parameters" tab to add query parameters or form data.
- Use the "Body" tab to add request body content in various formats (XML, JSON, etc.).

### Running Tests

- Click the <Button variant="tertiary" className="mx-1">Run</Button> button to send the request.
- View the response in the response panel, which displays status codes, headers, and body content.

#### Data-Driven Testing

- Use the "DataSource" feature to create a data source for your tests.
- Right-click on the project and select "New DataSource."
- Configure the data source settings, such as file type (CSV, Excel, etc.) and data mapping.
- Use the data source in your requests to run tests with multiple sets of data.

### Security Testing

- Use the security testing features to scan your APIs for vulnerabilities.
- Right-click on the project and select "Security Tests."
- Configure the security test settings and run the tests to identify potential issues.

### Load Testing

- Create a load test by right-clicking on the project and selecting "New Load Test."
- Configure the load test settings, including the number of virtual users and test duration.
- Run the load test to simulate high traffic and analyze API performance under load.

### Assertions

- Use the "Assertions" tab to add assertions to your requests.
- Right-click on the request and select "Add Assertion."
- Choose the type of assertion (e.g., "Response SLA," "XPath Match," etc.).
- Configure the assertion parameters and click "OK" to apply it.

### Validating Responses

- Use assertions to validate the response. Right-click on the request and select "Add Assertion."
- Choose the type of assertion (e.g., "Response SLA," "XPath Match," etc.).
- Configure the assertion parameters and click "OK" to apply it.

### Mocking Services

- Right-click on the project and select "New Mock Service."
- Configure the mock service settings, including the endpoint and response templates.
- Start the mock service to simulate API behavior for testing purposes.

### Generating Reports

- Use the reporting features to generate detailed reports on test results and API performance.
- Right-click on the project and select "Generate Report."
- Choose the report type (e.g., "Test Summary," "Performance Report," etc.)
- Configure the report settings and click "Generate" to create the report.

### Integrating with CI/CD

- SoapUI can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
- Use the command-line interface (CLI) to run SoapUI tests as part of your CI/CD workflow.
- Refer to the [SoapUI documentation](https://www.soapui.org/docs/command-line/) for detailed instructions on integrating with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps.
