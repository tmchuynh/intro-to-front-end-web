## Network Request APIs

The Network Request APIs provide a standardized way for web applications to make network requests, such as fetching data from APIs or submitting forms. These APIs simplify the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### XMLHttpRequest API

The XMLHttpRequest API is a traditional way to make network requests in web applications. It allows developers to send HTTP requests and handle responses asynchronously.

```javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data", true);
xhr.onload = function () {
  if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
    const response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    console.log("Data fetched successfully:", response);
  } else {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", xhr.statusText);
  }
};
xhr.onerror = function () {
  console.error("Network error occurred.");
};
xhr.send();
```

In this example, the XMLHttpRequest API is used to fetch data from an API endpoint. The response is parsed as JSON, and success or error messages are logged accordingly.

### Fetch API

The Fetch API is a modern alternative to the XMLHttpRequest API for making network requests. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle HTTP requests and responses using Promises.

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Data fetched successfully:", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

In this example, the Fetch API is used to fetch data from an API endpoint. The response is checked for success, parsed as JSON, and success or error messages are logged accordingly.
