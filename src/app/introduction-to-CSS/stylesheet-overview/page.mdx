# Stylesheets

## Table of Contents
Welcome to the world of CSS! If HTML is the backbone of your web pages, then CSS is the skin, clothes, and makeup that make it look good.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language that brings life and beauty to your HTML. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS is responsible for the visual presentation—colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and responsive design.

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house and CSS as the interior design, paint, furniture, and everything that makes it visually appealing and functional.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, and it's a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. The "cascading" part refers to how styles flow down and inherit from parent elements to child elements, creating a hierarchy of styling rules.

## Why Learn CSS?

- **Visual Control**: CSS gives you complete control over how your website looks—from colors and fonts to layouts and animations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps your content (HTML) separate from your presentation (CSS), making your code more maintainable
- **Responsive Design**: Create websites that look great on all devices—phones, tablets, and desktops
