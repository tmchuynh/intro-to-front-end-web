# Introduction to HTML

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the foundation of all web development. It's the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. Every website you visit is built with HTML at its core.

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house—it provides the essential structure that everything else builds upon. CSS adds the styling (like paint and furniture), and JavaScript adds interactivity (like electrical systems), but HTML is where it all begins.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's a markup language that uses tags to define elements and structure content on web pages. HTML tells the browser what each piece of content is—whether it's a heading, paragraph, image, link, or any other type of content.

### Key Characteristics of HTML:
- **Markup Language**: Uses tags to "mark up" content
- **Structure-Focused**: Defines the hierarchy and organization of content
- **Browser-Interpreted**: Browsers read HTML and display it visually
- **Text-Based**: Written in plain text with special tags
- **Standardized**: Maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)


## HTML Elements Example

Here are some common HTML elements in action:

```html
<!-- Headings create hierarchy -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>

<!-- Paragraphs for text content -->
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>

<!-- Links to other pages -->
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

<!-- Images -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description of the photo">

<!-- Lists -->
<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```
