# Introduction to HTML

## Table of Contents

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the foundation of all web development. It's the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. Every website you visit is built with HTML at its core.

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house—it provides the essential structure that everything else builds upon. CSS adds the styling (like paint and furniture), and JavaScript adds interactivity (like electrical systems), but HTML is where it all begins.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's a markup language that uses tags to define elements and structure content on web pages. HTML tells the browser what each piece of content is—whether it's a heading, paragraph, image, link, or any other type of content.

### Key Characteristics of HTML:
- **Markup Language**: Uses tags to "mark up" content
- **Structure-Focused**: Defines the hierarchy and organization of content
- **Browser-Interpreted**: Browsers read HTML and display it visually
- **Text-Based**: Written in plain text with special tags
- **Standardized**: Maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

## Why Learn HTML?

- **Foundation of the Web**: Every web page uses HTML
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple, logical syntax that's beginner-friendly
- **Universal Skill**: Essential for web developers, designers, and content creators
- **SEO Benefits**: Proper HTML structure improves search engine rankings
- **Accessibility**: Well-structured HTML makes content accessible to all users
- **Career Opportunities**: Required skill for front-end development roles

## HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
