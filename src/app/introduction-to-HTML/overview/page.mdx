# Introduction to HTML

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the foundation of all web development. It's the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. Every website you visit is built with HTML at its core.

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house—it provides the essential structure that everything else builds upon. CSS adds the styling (like paint and furniture), and JavaScript adds interactivity (like electrical systems), but HTML is where it all begins.

## What is HTML

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is like the blueprint of a website—it's the "skeleton" that provides structure to everything online. Think of it as the scaffolding holding up all the content. It uses "tags," commands wrapped in angle brackets (like `<p>` for paragraphs or `<img>` for images), to tell your browser how to display each piece of content. Most tags come in pairs—a start tag (`<p>`) and an end tag (`</p>`). Just remember to use a forward slash (/) in closing tags; a backslash (\) in HTML is about as useful as a chocolate teapot!

HTML is pretty relaxed about capitalization, so `<IMG>`, `<img>`, and `<Img>` are all fine. However, **XHTML**, the stricter sibling, requires lowercase and properly closed tags—like attending a fancy event where every detail matters. HTML is more like a casual gathering where the rules are flexible, and no one cares if your shoes don't match!

Key Characteristics of HTML:
- **Markup Language**: Uses tags to "mark up" content
- **Structure-Focused**: Defines the hierarchy and organization of content
- **Browser-Interpreted**: Browsers read HTML and display it visually
- **Text-Based**: Written in plain text with special tags
- **Standardized**: Maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage, consisting of a start tag, content, and an end tag. They define the structure and content of the page, allowing browsers to render text, images, links, and other media.

An HTML element typically looks like this:

```html
<elementName>Content goes here</elementName>
```

Here are some common HTML elements in action:

```html
<!-- Headings create hierarchy -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>

<!-- Paragraphs for text content -->
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>

<!-- Links to other pages -->
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

<!-- Images -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description of the photo">

<!-- Lists -->
<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```
### Element Content

HTML elements can contain different types of content, which can be classified as either block-level elements or inline elements.

- **Block-Level Elements**: These elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples include `<div>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ol>`, and `<ul>`.

- **Inline Elements**: These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, and `<img>`.


### Element Nesting

HTML elements can be nested within each other, allowing for complex structures. Nesting means placing one element inside another, creating a parent-child relationship.
For example, you can nest a `<span>` inside a `<p>` to style part of the paragraph:

```html
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
```

## Void Elements

Void elements, also known as **self-closing** or **empty elements**, do not have any content or child elements. They are defined in HTML without a closing tag.

**Examples**:

- `<br>`: Inserts a line break.

- `<hr>`: Creates a thematic break (horizontal line).

- `<img>`: Used to embed images.

- `<input>`: Used for input fields in forms.

**CAUTION**

> If you add a closing tag to a void element (e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`), it may lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues, especially in older browsers. Void elements are self-closing, meaning they do not require a closing tag, and adding one violates HTML specifications.

In modern browsers, most of the time, adding a closing tag to void elements is ignored or treated as an extra tag, but it's best to avoid it to maintain proper HTML structure and ensure compatibility. Stick to the correct syntax to prevent potential problems down the line.

## Script, Style and Link Elements

These elements are crucial for integrating scripts and stylesheets into your HTML document.

**`<script>`**: Used to include JavaScript code or link to an external JavaScript file.

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

**`<style>`**: Allows you to include CSS styles directly within the HTML document.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
</style>
```

**`<link>`**: Used to link external resources such as stylesheets.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```


## External Resources

HTML can reference external resources such as images, videos, scripts, and styles. This is done through specific elements that allow you to integrate content from different sources.

**Examples**:

- **Images**: Using the `<img>` tag to embed images.

- **Links**: Using the `<a>` tag to link to other web pages or resources.

- **Videos**: Using the `<video>` tag to embed video files.

### Different Types of Links

There are four (4) different types of links that can be included on a web page:

- External links leading to pages on other websites

- Internal links that connect to different pages within the website

- Email links which will open the user's default email client pre-filled with a "to" address

- Anchor links to jump to a specific section of a web page

There are different ways you can control the way a link will behave as well:

- `target="_blank"` → opens the link in a new browser window or tab

- `rel="nofollow"` → tells the search engines not to follow the link and is often used to external links you don't want to endorse

- `title` → provides a tooltip with information that appears when the user hovers over the link
