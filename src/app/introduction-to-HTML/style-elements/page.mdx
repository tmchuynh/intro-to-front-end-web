## Styling Text with HTML

HTML provides a variety of tags to style text, but most styling is better handled with CSS. However, there are some basic HTML tags that can be used for text styling. Below is a list of commonly used HTML tags for styling text:

HTML offers a handful of essential tags to style text but most of styling will be better done within stylesheets. Here's a list of some:

| HTML Tag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<b>` | Makes text bold. |
| `<i>` | Makes text italic. |
| `<u>` | Underlines text. |
| `<s>` | Strikes through text. |
| `<mark>` | Highlights text. |
| `<small>` | Makes text smaller. |
| `<strong>` | Indicates strong importance, typically bold. |
| `<em>` | Indicates emphasis, typically italic. |
| `<sub>` | Displays text as subscript. |
| `<sup>` | Displays text as superscript. |
| `<br>` | Inserts a line break. |
| `<wbr>` | Suggests a line break opportunity. |
| `<hr>` | Inserts a horizontal rule (line). |
| `<time>` | Represents a specific time or date. |
| `<abbr>` | Represents an abbreviation or acronym. |
| `<q>` | Represents a short inline quotation. |
| `<blockquote>` | Represents a longer quotation, typically block-level. |
| `<code>` | Represents a fragment of computer code. |
| `<pre>` | Represents preformatted text, preserving whitespace and line breaks. |
| `<var>` | Represents a variable in programming or mathematical expressions. |
| `<kbd>` | Represents user input, typically keyboard input. |
| `<cite>` | Represents a reference to a creative work, such as a book or article. |
| `<address>` | Represents contact information for the author or owner of a document or article. |


```html
<p>This is a <b>bold</b> word, an <i>italic</i> word, and a <u>underlined</u> word.</p>
<p>This is a <s>strikethrough</s> word, a <mark>highlighted</mark> word, and a <small>smaller</small> word.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>strongly emphasized</strong> word, an <em>emphasized</em> word, a <sub>subscripted</sub> word, and a <sup>superscripted</sup> word.</p>
```

**NOTE**

<blockquote>
Using HTML tags like `<br>`, `<small>`, or `<b>` for styling can lead to cluttered and outdated code. These tags mix content with presentation, making your HTML less flexible and harder to maintain. Instead, use CSS for styling to keep your structure clean and separation of concerns intact.

For example, instead of `<br>` to create space, use margin or padding in your CSS. This approach improves readability, scalability, and ensures your code adheres to modern web development standards.

    <h1>A Journey Through Time</h1>
    <p>
      On <time datetime="2023-09-21">September 21, 2023</time>, a young
      adventurer named <strong>Emily</strong> discovered an old book in her
      attic. The book was filled with stories of ancient civilizations and
      legends of hidden treasures.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      One story caught her eye: it mentioned the lost city of
      <abbr title="Atlantis">AT</abbr>. Legends claimed it was submerged under
      the sea and held treasures beyond imagination. <br />
      Determined to find it, Emily packed her bags, ready for the adventure of a
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she set sail, she recalled her grandmother's words:
      <q
        >Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the strength to move forward
        despite it.</q
      >
      <small><u>Grandma Joan</u></small>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Days turned into weeks, and just as she was about to lose hope, a storm
      hit. The waves crashed around her, but she remembered the glowing map she
      found in the book. It led her to a hidden island.
      <mark>Could this be the location of Atlantis?</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stepped onto the island, heart racing. <br />
      She knew this was just the beginning of her journey. With each step, she
      felt the thrill of the unknown, ready to uncover secrets long buried
      beneath the ocean's surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she explored, she marveled at the beauty around her and whispered to
      herself, <q>This is only the first chapter of my adventure.</q>
      <wbr />
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
