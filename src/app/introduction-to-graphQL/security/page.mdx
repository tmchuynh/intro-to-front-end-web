# GraphQL Security

## Table of Contents

## Overview

GraphQL security encompasses the practices and measures specifically designed to protect GraphQL APIs from threats and vulnerabilities. While GraphQL offers many advantages like flexible queries and strong typing, it also introduces unique security challenges that differ from traditional REST APIs. These include query complexity attacks, information disclosure through introspection, and authorization challenges with nested resolvers.

GraphQL's flexibility can be a double-edged sword - while it allows clients to request exactly the data they need, it also provides attackers with powerful tools to craft malicious queries that can overwhelm servers or extract sensitive information. Understanding and implementing proper security measures is crucial for building secure GraphQL APIs.
