## Table of Contents

## Overview

Security in web development refers to the practices and measures taken to protect web applications from threats and vulnerabilities. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and strategies aimed at safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring user privacy, and maintaining the integrity of web applications. Security is a critical aspect of web development, as it directly impacts user trust, compliance with regulations, and the overall success of a web application.

### Core Concepts

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions within a web application. Common authentication methods include username/password combinations, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and OAuth.
- **Authorization**: The process of granting or denying access to resources based on the authenticated user's permissions. Authorization determines what actions a user can perform within a web application, such as viewing, editing, or deleting data.
- **Encryption**: The process of converting data into a secure format that is unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. Encryption is used to protect sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card information, and personal details, both in transit (during transmission over networks) and at rest (when stored on servers).
- **Input Validation**: The practice of ensuring that user input is safe and conforms to expected formats before processing it. Input validation helps prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection, by rejecting or sanitizing malicious input.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS attacks can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities. Preventing XSS involves validating and sanitizing user input, using secure coding practices, and implementing Content Security Policies (CSP).
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: A security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick users into performing actions on a web application without their consent. CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in the user's browser. Preventing CSRF involves using anti-CSRF tokens, validating requests, and implementing same-site cookies.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure. This is typically achieved using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS), which encrypts the data in transit to protect it from eavesdropping and tampering. Secure communication is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials and personal data, during transmission over the internet.
- **Security Headers**: HTTP headers that provide additional security measures for web applications. Common security headers include Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). These headers help mitigate various security risks, such as clickjacking, MIME sniffing,
