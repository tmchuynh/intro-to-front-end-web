## Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. They are useful for iterating over arrays, objects, or performing repetitive tasks.

## Types of Loops

### For Loop

`for` loops are used when you know the number of iterations in advance. They consist of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("i =", i);
}
```

- `for` loop initializes i to 0, checks if i is less than 5, and increments i by 1 in each iteration
- The loop executes the console.log statement as long as i is less than 5

##### Criteria for Using for Loops

When deciding whether to use a `for` loop, consider the following criteria:

- The number of iterations is known or can be determined beforehand.
- You need to access elements by index or perform operations on each element.
- You want to perform a specific action a fixed number of times, such as counting or generating a sequence of numbers.

| **Iterating Arrays**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Use `for` loops to iterate over arrays when you need to access elements by index or perform operations on each element. This is particularly useful for arrays with a known length or when you need to modify elements during iteration.                                                                                                            |
| **Counting**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use `for` loops to count or perform actions a specific number of times, such as iterating through a fixed number of iterations or processing a known range of values. This is useful for scenarios where you need to repeat an action a predetermined number of times, such as generating a sequence of numbers or processing a fixed set of items. |
| **Nested Iteration**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Use `for` loops for nested iterations, such as iterating over multi-dimensional arrays or performing operations on combinations of elements. This is useful for scenarios where you need to access elements in a structured way, such as processing a matrix or performing operations on pairs of elements.                                         |
| **Conditional Logic**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Use `for` loops to implement conditional logic within the loop body, allowing you to perform different actions based on specific conditions. This is useful for scenarios where you need to check conditions or perform different actions based on the current iteration, such as filtering elements or applying transformations. |
| **Performance Optimization**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use `for` loops for performance-critical operations where you need fine-grained control over the iteration process. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to optimize performance, such as processing large datasets or performing complex calculations that require efficient iteration.                                        |

### For...of Loop

`for...of` loops are used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and other collections. They provide a simpler syntax compared to traditional for loops.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log("Fruit:", fruit);
}
```

- `for (let fruit of fruits)` iterates over each element in the fruits array
- The loop executes the console.log statement for each fruit in the array

##### Criteria for Using For...of Loops

When deciding whether to use a `for...of` loop, consider the following criteria:

- You want to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or other collections.
- You do not need access to the index of the elements.
- You want a simpler syntax for iterating over elements without needing to manage the loop variable explicitly.

###### `for...of` VS `for` Loop

- Use `for...of` when you want to iterate over iterable objects like arrays or strings
- Use `for` loops when you need more control over the iteration, such as accessing the index or modifying the loop variable
  <BackToTop />

### While Loop

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
  console.log("count =", count);
  count++;
}
```

- `while (count < 5)` repeatedly executes the loop body as long as count is less than 5
- `count++` increments the count variable by 1 after each iteration

##### Criteria for Using While Loops

When deciding whether to use a `while` loop, consider the following criteria:

- The number of iterations is not known in advance, and you want to continue until a specific condition is met.
- You want to perform an action repeatedly until a certain condition becomes false, such as waiting for user input or checking for a specific state.
- You need to handle scenarios where the loop may not execute at all if the condition is false initially, such as waiting for a specific event or checking for a condition that may not be true at the start.

| Use Case                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User Input**          | Continuously prompt the user for input until a valid response is received, such as asking for a password or confirmation.                                                                                                |
| **Polling**             | Repeatedly check a condition or state until it changes, such as waiting for a server response or checking for updates in a data source.                                                                                  |
| **Game Loops**          | In game development, `while` loops are often used to keep the game running, updating the game state, and rendering frames until the game is exited.                                                                      |
| **Data Processing**     | When processing data in batches, `while` loops can be used to iterate through chunks of data until all data is processed, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.                                             |
| **Event Handling**      | In event-driven programming, `while` loops can be used to continuously listen for events or user interactions, allowing the application to respond dynamically to user actions or system events.                         |
| **Background Tasks**    | Running background tasks that need to execute continuously, such as monitoring system performance or handling real-time data streams.                                                                                    |
| **Data Validation**     | Validating user input or data until a valid condition is met, such as checking for valid email formats or ensuring required fields are filled out before proceeding.                                                     |
| **Resource Management** | Managing resources like file handles or network connections, where you need to continuously check for availability or perform cleanup tasks until all resources are released.                                            |
| **Retry Logic**         | Implementing retry logic for operations that may fail, such as network requests or database operations, where you want to keep trying until a successful response is received or a maximum number of retries is reached. |
| **Data Streaming**      | Processing data streams in real-time, where you want to continuously read and process incoming data until the stream ends or a specific condition is met, such as reaching the end of a file or stream.                  |

### Do...while Loop

`do...while` loops are similar to `while` loops, but they guarantee that the loop body is executed at least once before checking the condition.

```javascript
let count = 0;
do {
  console.log("count =", count);
  count++;
} while (count < 5);
```

- The loop executes the console.log statement first, then checks if count is less than 5
- This ensures that the loop body runs at least once, even if the condition is false initially

##### Criteria for Using Do...while Loops

When deciding whether to use a `do...while` loop, consider the following criteria:

- You want to ensure that the loop body is executed at least once, regardless of the initial condition.
- You need to perform an action before checking a condition, such as prompting for user input or performing an operation that must occur before validating a condition.
- You want to handle scenarios where the loop body must run at least once, such as initializing variables or performing setup tasks before checking a condition.

###### `do...while` VS `while` Loop

- The `do...while` loop guarantees at least one execution of the loop body, while the `while` loop may not execute at all if the condition is false initially.
- Use `do...while` when you need to ensure that the loop body runs at least once, such as when prompting for user input or performing an action that must occur before checking a condition.

### Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops inside other loops. They are useful for iterating over multi-dimensional data structures like arrays of arrays.

```javascript
let matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
    console.log("Element at matrix[" + i + "][" + j + "] =", matrix[i][j]);
  }
}
```

- The outer loop iterates over each row of the matrix
- The inner loop iterates over each element in the current row
- This allows you to access each element in a two-dimensional array

##### Criteria for Using Nested Loops

When deciding whether to use nested loops, consider the following criteria:

- You need to iterate over multi-dimensional data structures, such as matrices or grids, where each element is accessed by multiple indices.
- You want to perform operations on combinations of elements, such as comparing pairs of elements or generating combinations of values.
- You need to handle complex data structures like trees or graphs, where nested loops can be used to traverse and process each node or edge.

| Use Case                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-dimensional Arrays** | Nested loops are commonly used to iterate over multi-dimensional arrays, such as matrices or grids, allowing you to access each element in a structured way.                                    |
| **Complex Data Structures**  | When dealing with complex data structures like trees or graphs, nested loops can be used to traverse and process each node or edge, enabling you to perform operations on the entire structure. |
| **Matrix Operations**        | Performing operations on matrices, such as addition, multiplication, or transposition, often requires nested loops to access and manipulate each element in the matrices.                       |
| **Grid-based Games**         | In grid-based games, nested loops are used to iterate over the game board or grid, allowing you to check for collisions, update positions, or render elements based on their coordinates.       |
| **Data Processing**          | When processing structured data, such as CSV files or JSON objects, nested loops can be used to iterate over rows and columns, enabling you to extract and manipulate data efficiently.         |

### Infinite Loops

An infinite loop occurs when the loop condition is always true, causing the loop to run indefinitely. This can lead to performance issues or crashes if not handled properly.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log("This will run forever");
  i++;
  if (i === 10) {
    break; // Exits the loop after 10 iterations
  }
}
```

- The `while (true)` condition creates an infinite loop
- The `break` statement is used to exit the loop after 10 iterations to prevent it from running indefinitely

##### Criteria for Using Infinite Loops

When deciding whether to use an infinite loop, consider the following criteria:

- You need to continuously execute a block of code until a specific condition is met, such as waiting for user input or monitoring a system state.
- You want to keep the application responsive by continuously checking for events or user interactions, such as in event-driven programming.
- You need to implement a background task that runs continuously, such as monitoring system performance or handling real-time data streams.

| Use Case             | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server Listening** | In server applications, an infinite loop is often used to keep the server running and listening for incoming requests.                                                            |
| **Game Loops**       | In game development, an infinite loop is used to continuously update the game state and render frames until the game is exited.                                                   |
| **Event Listeners**  | In event-driven programming, an infinite loop can be used to keep the application responsive by waiting for user input or events.                                                 |
| **Polling**          | Continuously checking for changes in data or state, such as monitoring a sensor or waiting for user input.                                                                        |
| **Background Tasks** | Running background tasks that need to execute continuously, such as monitoring system performance or handling real-time data streams.                                             |
| **Data Processing**  | Processing large datasets in chunks, where the loop continues until all data is processed or a specific condition is met.                                                         |
| **Monitoring**       | Continuously monitoring system health, network status, or application performance to detect issues or anomalies.                                                                  |
| **Testing**          | Running tests or simulations that require continuous execution until a specific condition is met, such as reaching a certain number of iterations or achieving a desired outcome. |
| **User Interaction** | Keeping the application responsive to user interactions, such as waiting for button clicks or keyboard input in a graphical user interface.                                       |

**Caution**:

> Infinite loops can cause your program to become unresponsive or crash if not handled properly. Always ensure there is a condition to exit the loop, or use mechanisms like `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to control the execution flow.

### Break and Continue Statements

`break` and `continue` statements are used to control the flow of loops.

- `break` exits the loop immediately, while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log("i =", i);
}
```

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skips the current iteration if i is even
  }
  console.log("i =", i); // Only prints odd numbers
}
```

## Criteria for Using Break and Continue Statements

When deciding whether to use `break` or `continue` statements, consider the following criteria:

- **Early Exit**: Use `break` to exit a loop early when a specific condition is met, such as finding a match in a search operation or reaching a certain threshold in calculations.
- **Skipping Iterations**: Use `continue` to skip the current iteration of a loop when a condition is met, such as ignoring invalid data or skipping certain values in an array.
- **Nested Loops**: In nested loops, `break` can be used to exit the inner loop while continuing the outer loop, or vice versa. This is useful for controlling complex iterations where you want to exit one level of nesting without affecting the other.
- **Conditional Logic**: Use `break` and `continue` to implement conditional logic within loops, allowing you to control the flow based on specific criteria. For example, you can break out of a loop when a certain condition is met, or continue to the next iteration when a condition is not satisfied.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  Use `break` to optimize performance by exiting loops early when a condition is met, reducing unnecessary iterations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you are searching for a specific value or condition and can stop processing once it is found.
- **Error Handling**: Use `break` to exit a loop when an error condition is encountered, allowing you to handle the error gracefully without continuing with further iterations. This can help prevent further issues or incorrect results in your program.
- **User Interaction**:
  Use `break` to exit loops based on user input or interaction, allowing you to respond to user actions and control the flow of your program. For example, you can break out of a loop when the user provides a specific input or clicks a button, allowing you to handle the interaction appropriately.

| **Early Exit**               | Use `break` to exit a loop early when a specific condition is met, such as finding a match in a search operation or reaching a certain threshold in calculations.                                                                                                                   |
| **Skipping Iterations**      | Use `continue` to skip the current iteration of a loop when a condition is met, such as ignoring invalid data or skipping certain values in an array.                                                                                                                               |
| **Nested Loops**             | In nested loops, `break` can be used to exit the inner loop while continuing the outer loop, or vice versa. This is useful for controlling complex iterations where you want to exit one level of nesting without affecting the other.                                              |
| **Conditional Logic**        | Use `break` and `continue` to implement conditional logic within loops, allowing you to control the flow based on specific criteria. For example, you can break out of a loop when a certain condition is met, or continue to the next iteration when a condition is not satisfied. |
| **Performance Optimization** |

| Use `break` to optimize performance by exiting loops early when a condition is met, reducing unnecessary iterations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you are searching for a specific value or condition and can stop processing once it is found.
| **Error Handling** | Use `break` to exit a loop when an error condition is encountered, allowing you to handle the error gracefully without continuing with further iterations. This can help prevent further issues or incorrect results in your program.
| **User Interaction** | Use `break` to exit loops based on user input or interaction, allowing you to respond to user actions and control the flow of your program. For example, you can break out of a loop when the user provides a specific input or clicks a button, allowing you to handle the interaction appropriately. |

## Decision Making

Decision-making constructs allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are essential for controlling the flow of your program and making decisions based on user input or other criteria.

Decision-making constructs include conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `switch`, as well as ternary operators. These constructs help you implement logic in your code, enabling it to respond dynamically to different situations.

Decision-making constructs are crucial for implementing logic in your code, allowing it to respond dynamically to different situations. They enable you to create more complex and interactive applications by allowing the program to make decisions based on user input or other criteria.

### Conditional Statements (if/else)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are essential for controlling the flow of your program.

```javascript
let number = 10;

if (number > 5) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 5.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is 5 or less.");
}
```

- `if (number > 5)` checks if the value of number is greater than 5
- If true, it executes the code block within the if statement
- If false, it executes the code block within the else statement

##### Criteria for Using Conditional Statements

When deciding whether to use conditional statements, consider the following criteria:

- You need to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions, such as user input or the state of a variable.
- You want to implement logic that allows your program to make decisions, such as checking if a user is logged in or validating input data.
- You need to handle different scenarios or outcomes based on the values of variables, such as displaying different messages based on user roles or processing data differently based on its type.

### Switch Statements

The `switch` statement is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of a variable or expression. It is often used as an alternative to multiple `if-else`
statements.

```javascript
let day = 3;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
```

- The `switch` statement evaluates the value of `day`
- It matches the value against each `case`
- If a match is found, it executes the corresponding block of code
- The `break` statement exits the switch block, preventing fall-through to subsequent cases
- If no match is found, the `default` case is executed

##### Criteria for Using Switch Statements

When deciding whether to use a `switch` statement, consider the following criteria:

- You have multiple conditions to check against a single variable or expression, and using multiple `if-else` statements would make the code less readable.
- The conditions are based on discrete values, such as integers or strings, rather than ranges or complex expressions.
- You want to improve code readability and maintainability by grouping related conditions together, making it easier to understand the flow of logic in your program.
- You need to handle a fixed set of possible values for a variable, such as days of the week, months of the year, or specific command options, where using a `switch` statement can provide a clearer structure than multiple `if-else` statements.

## Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They can be categorized into arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, etc.

```javascript
let sum = 5 + 10; // Arithmetic operator
let isTrue = 5 > 3 && 10 < 15; // Logical operator
```

| Use Case                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Use arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` to perform mathematical calculations on numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. These operators are essential for performing calculations in your code, such as computing totals, averages, or performing mathematical transformations on data.                                                                             |
| **Assignment Operations** | Use assignment operators like `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` to assign values to variables or update their values based on existing values. These operators are crucial for managing state in your code, allowing you to store and manipulate data effectively. For example, you can use `x += 5` to add 5 to the current value of `x`, or `y *= 2` to double the value of `y`.                                       |
| **Comparison Operations** | Use comparison operators like `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` to compare values and determine their relationships. These operators are essential for implementing conditional logic in your code, allowing you to make decisions based on the values of variables. For example, you can use `if (x > y)` to check if `x` is greater than `y`, or `if (a === b)` to check if `a` is strictly equal to `b`. |
| **Logical Operations**    | Use logical operators like `&&`, `\|\|`, and `!` to combine or negate boolean values. These operators are crucial for implementing complex conditions in your code, allowing you to create more decision-making logic. For example, you can use `if (isValid && isActive)` to check if both conditions are true, or `if (!isError)` to check if there is no error.                                                           |
| **Bitwise Operations**    | Use bitwise operators like `&`, `\|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, and `>>` to perform operations on individual bits of numbers. These operators are useful for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating binary data or implementing bitwise algorithms. For example, you can use `x & y` to perform a bitwise AND operation between `x` and `y`, or `x << 2` to shift the bits of `x` two positions to the left.                |
| **String Operations**     | Use string operators like `+` for concatenation to combine strings or create new strings from existing ones. This is essential for building dynamic messages, formatting output, or constructing complex strings based on user input or data. For example, you can use `let message = "Hello, " + name + "!"` to create a personalized greeting message.                                                                     |
| **Ternary Operator**      | Use the ternary operator `? :` to perform conditional assignments or evaluations in a concise manner. This operator allows you to write simple conditional expressions in a single line, making your code more readable and reducing the need for verbose `if-else` statements. For example, you can use `let result = (x > y) ? "x is greater" : "y is greater"` to assign a value based on a condition.                    |
| **Type Checking**         | Use the `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable or value. This is useful for debugging, validating input, or ensuring that variables are of the expected type before performing operations on them. For example, you can use `if (typeof x === "number")` to check if `x` is a number before performing arithmetic operations.                                                                                     |
| **Instance Checking**     | Use the `instanceof` operator to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function. This is useful for validating object types, ensuring that objects conform to expected structures, or implementing polymorphism in your code. For example, you can use `if (obj instanceof MyClass)` to check if `obj` is an instance of `MyClass`.                                                           |
| **Nullish Coalescing**    | Use the nullish coalescing operator `??` to provide a default value when a variable is `null` or `undefined`. This operator is useful for handling optional values or providing fallback values in your code. For example, you can use `let value = userInput ?? "default"` to assign a default value if `userInput` is `null` or `undefined`.                                                                               |
| **Optional Chaining**     | Use the optional chaining operator `?.` to safely access properties or methods of an object that may be `null` or `undefined`. This operator prevents runtime errors by returning `undefined` instead of throwing an error when trying to access a property of a non-existent object. For example, you can use `let name = user?.profile?.name` to safely access the `name` property of the `profile` object if it exists.   |

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. The most common arithmetic operators are addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b; // Addition
let difference = a - b; // Subtraction
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b; // Division
let remainder = a % b; // Modulus (remainder of division)
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is the equals sign (`=`), but there are also compound assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` that combine assignment with arithmetic operations.

```javascript
let x = 10; // Assignment
x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5 (Addition assignment)
x -= 3; // Equivalent to x = x - 3 (Subtraction assignment)
x *= 2; // Equivalent to x = x * 2 (Multiplication assignment)
x /= 4; // Equivalent to x = x / 4 (Division assignment)
x %= 3; // Equivalent to x = x % 3 (Modulus assignment)
```

<BackToTop />

### Comparison Operators

##### Equality Operator VS Identity Operator

```javascript
console.log(5 == "5"); // Outputs: true
```

**Identity Operator** (`===`): Compares both value and type without type coercion. Prefer this operator when you want to ensure both the value and type are exactly the same. This is generally considered best practice in JavaScript, as it avoids potential pitfalls associated with type coercion:

```javascript
console.log(5 === "5"); // Outputs: false
```

##### CAUTION

> JavaScript automatically converts types in certain situations, which can lead to unexpected results. Using `==` allows type coercion, where values are converted before comparison, causing confusion. To avoid this, use `===` for strict equality, as it checks both value and type without coercion. Understanding type coercion helps prevent errors and ensures accurate comparisons.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean values. The most common logical operators are `AND` (`&&`), `OR` (`||`), and `NOT` (`!`).

```javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;
let resultAnd = a && b; // false, both must be true
let resultOr = a || b; // true, at least one must be true
let resultNot = !a; // false, negates the value
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of numbers. They are less commonly used but can be useful for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating binary data or implementing bitwise algorithms.

```javascript
let x = 5; // Binary: 0101
let y = 3; // Binary: 0011
let andResult = x & y; // Bitwise AND: 0001 (1 in decimal)
let orResult = x | y; // Bitwise OR: 0111 (7 in decimal)
let xorResult = x ^ y; // Bitwise XOR: 0110 (6 in decimal)
let notResult = ~x; // Bitwise NOT: 1010 (-6 in decimal)
let leftShiftResult = x << 1; // Left shift: 1010 (10 in decimal)
let rightShiftResult = x >> 1; // Right shift: 0010 (2 in decimal)
```

### String Operators

String operators are used to manipulate strings. The most common string operator is concatenation (`+`), which combines two or more strings into one.

```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // Concatenation
console.log(fullName); // Outputs: "John Doe"
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an `if-else` statement. It takes three operands: a condition, a value if true, and a value if false.

```javascript
let age = 18;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"; // If age is 18 or more, canVote is "Yes", otherwise "No"
console.log(canVote); // Outputs: "Yes"
```

### Type Checking

The `typeof` operator is used to check the type of a variable or value. It returns a string representing the type of the operand.

```javascript
let x = 42;
console.log(typeof x); // Outputs: "number"
let y = "Hello";
console.log(typeof y); // Outputs: "string"
let z = true;
console.log(typeof z); // Outputs: "boolean"
let obj = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(typeof obj); // Outputs: "object"
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(typeof arr); // Outputs: "object" (arrays are also objects in JavaScript)
let func = function () {};
console.log(typeof func); // Outputs: "function"
let undef;
console.log(typeof undef); // Outputs: "undefined"
let nul = null;
console.log(typeof nul); // Outputs: "object" (this is a known quirk in JavaScript)
```

### Instance Checking

The `instanceof` operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function. It returns `true` if the object is an instance of the specified class, and `false` otherwise.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
let alice = new Person("Alice");
console.log(alice instanceof Person); // Outputs: true
console.log(alice instanceof Array); // Outputs: false
```

### Nullish Coalescing

The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is used to provide a default value when a variable is `null` or `undefined`. It returns the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is `null` or `undefined`, otherwise it returns the left-hand operand.

```javascript
let userInput = null;
let value = userInput ?? "default"; // If userInput is null or undefined, value is "default"
console.log(value); // Outputs: "default"
```

### Optional Chaining

The optional chaining operator (`?.`) is used to safely access properties or methods of an object that may be `null` or `undefined`. It prevents runtime errors by returning `undefined` instead of throwing an error when trying to access a property of a non-existent object.

```javascript
let user = {
  profile: {
    name: "Alice",
  },
};
let name = user.profile?.name; // Safely access name property, returns "Alice"
console.log(name); // Outputs: "Alice"

let age = user.profile?.age; // Safely access age property, returns undefined since it doesn't exist
console.log(age); // Outputs: undefined
```
