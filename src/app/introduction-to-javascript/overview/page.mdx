# Introduction to JavaScript

## Table of Contents

**JavaScript** is the programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles presentation, JavaScript brings your web pages to life with interactivity, animations, and dynamic content updates.

JavaScript is the only programming language that runs natively in web browsers, making it an essential skill for anyone wanting to create modern, interactive websites.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was originally created to add interactivity to web pages. Today, it's used for:

- **Front-end development** - Interactive user interfaces
- **Back-end development** - Server-side applications (Node.js)
- **Mobile app development** - React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop applications** - Electron
- **Game development** - Browser-based games
- **Machine learning** - TensorFlow.js
  JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (on the server) programming. It allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications that respond to user input, fetch data from servers, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
