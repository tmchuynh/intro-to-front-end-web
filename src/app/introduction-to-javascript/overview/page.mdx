# Overview

## Table of Contents

**JavaScript** is the programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles presentation, JavaScript brings your web pages to life with interactivity, animations, and dynamic content updates.

JavaScript is the only programming language that runs natively in web browsers, making it an essential skill for anyone wanting to create modern, interactive websites.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was originally created to add interactivity to web pages. Today, it's used for:

- **Front-end development** - Interactive user interfaces
- **Back-end development** - Server-side applications (Node.js)
- **Mobile app development** - React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop applications** - Electron
- **Game development** - Browser-based games
- **Machine learning** - TensorFlow.js
  JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (on the server) programming. It allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications that respond to user input, fetch data from servers, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).

**Here's a fun twist**

> JavaScript wasn't always called that! It started off as **LiveScript**, but during the height of Java's popularity, they decided to pull a marketing move and rename it **JavaScript** – even though the two languages are about as related as a cat and a toaster. It's like calling a bicycle a "car-bike" to cash in on car fame.

Despite the misleading name, JavaScript is the magic behind the interactive web. It takes static pages – think of them as nice posters – and turns them into lively, engaging experiences. Thanks to JavaScript, websites aren't just pretty to look at; they react to user actions with animations, games, or even those sassy error messages when you mistype your password. In short, JavaScript is the web's secret sauce, making user interaction possible and elevating web pages from static displays to dynamic experiences.

**NOTE**

> Overloading your website with too much JavaScript can lead to performance issues, such as slow loading times and a laggy user experience. Excessive scripts can also increase the complexity of your code, making it harder to maintain and debug. Additionally, relying heavily on JavaScript may hinder accessibility for users with disabilities or those using older browsers. It's crucial to strike a balance; use JavaScript judiciously to enhance functionality while ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

## The `<script>` Element

The `<script>` element is used to embed or reference JavaScript code in an HTML document.
It can contain inline JavaScript or link to an external JavaScript file. The `<script>` element is typically placed in the `<head>` or `<body>` sections of an HTML document, allowing developers to execute JavaScript code at specific points during the page load process. It is a powerful tool for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to write JavaScript code that can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events, and perform various tasks to enhance the user experience. By placing scripts in the appropriate sections of an HTML document, developers can control when and how their JavaScript code is executed, ensuring that the page behaves as intended.

It can be used to include JavaScript code directly within an HTML document or to link to an external JavaScript file. This element is essential for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
When using the `<script>` element, you can either write JavaScript code directly within the tags
or link to an external JavaScript file using the `src` attribute. The code inside the `<script>` tags is executed by the browser when the page loads, allowing you to manipulate the DOM, respond to user events, and perform various tasks dynamically. It is a fundamental part of web development, enabling developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to their web pages. It allows for the execution of JavaScript code, which can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events, and perform various tasks to enhance the user experience.

It can also be used to link to an external JavaScript file using the `src` attribute. This allows you to keep your JavaScript code separate from your HTML, making it easier to manage and maintain. When the browser encounters a `<script>` element with a `src` attribute, it fetches the specified JavaScript file and executes its contents as part of the page loading process.

The `<script>` element is used to include JavaScript code in an HTML document. It can be placed in two main locations:

1. **In the `<head>` section**: This is where you can include scripts that need to be loaded before the content of the page is rendered. This is useful for scripts that set up global variables or functions that will be used throughout the page.
2. **In the `<body>` section**: This is where you can include scripts that manipulate the content of the page after it has been loaded. This is useful for scripts that need to interact with the DOM or respond to user interactions.

In those cases, the code would be embedded like so:

```html
<script>
  alert("Hello, World!");
</script>
```

Scripts can also be placed in external files, similar to CSS, and linked as shown below:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

**CAUTION**

<blockquote>
If the source of an external JavaScript file is given, the embedded script will be ignored. A single `<script>` tag cannot have both a source attribute and code inside. Therefore, the following code will not run properly

```html
<script src="script.js">
  alert(1);
</script>
```

Instead, the choice to have an external JavaScript file or have an embedded script needs to be made. The following example shows how you can split the code into two scripts in an HTML document in order to include both:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
```

</blockquote>

But listen to this, a web page can absolutely dazzle without a single line of JavaScript! HTML and CSS, with maybe a sprinkle of utility code, can create interactive and stylish elements that shine on their own. In web development, the golden rule is to use the simplest tool for the job. Stick to HTML when you can, and opt for CSS when it does the trick – saving JavaScript as a last resort.

While JavaScript is undeniably powerful, it can also be a bit of a heavyweight, potentially causing loading delays or frustrations for users who rely on keyboards or assistive technologies. JavaScript works imperatively, bossing the browser around step-by-step, while HTML and CSS operate declaratively, simply stating what should happen and letting the browser handle the details. This can often lead to a more efficient and user-friendly experience. You'd be amazed at what kind of magic you can conjure up with just HTML and CSS – no JavaScript required!

For example, this image slider is made of purely HTML and CSS:

```html
<div class="slider">
  <!-- Radio buttons for each slide -->
  <input type="radio" name="slider" id="slide1" checked />
  <input type="radio" name="slider" id="slide2" />
  <input type="radio" name="slider" id="slide3" />
  <input type="radio" name="slider" id="slide4" />
  <input type="radio" name="slider" id="slide5" />

  <!-- The slides (image container) -->
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=Slide+1" alt="Slide 1" />
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=Slide+2" alt="Slide 2" />
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=Slide+3" alt="Slide 3" />
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=Slide+4" alt="Slide 4" />
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=Slide+5" alt="Slide 5" />
  </div>

  <!-- Navigation dots -->
  <div class="navigation">
    <label for="slide1"></label>
    <label for="slide2"></label>
    <label for="slide3"></label>
    <label for="slide4"></label>
    <label for="slide5"></label>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Positions the slider relative to its parent */
.slider {
  position: relative;
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: auto;
  /* Hides any overflow content, such as images outside the slider area */
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Hides the radio buttons, as they are not needed for visible controls */
input[type="radio"] {
  display: none;
}

/* Arranges the images in a row */
.slides {
  display: flex;
  width: 500%;
  /* Smoothly transitions the slider position when images change */
  transition: transform 1s ease;
}

.slides img {
  width: 20%;
}

/* Controls the position of the slider for each radio button */
#slide1:checked ~ .slides {
  transform: translateX(0%);
}

#slide2:checked ~ .slides {
  transform: translateX(-20%);
}

#slide3:checked ~ .slides {
  transform: translateX(-40%);
}

#slide4:checked ~ .slides {
  transform: translateX(-60%);
}

#slide5:checked ~ .slides {
  transform: translateX(-80%);
}

/* Create navigation dots */
.navigation {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  bottom: 15px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* Style each dot */
.navigation label {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 15px;
  height: 15px;
  margin: 0 5px;
  background: #ddd;
  border-radius: 50%;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background s;
}

/* Highlight active dot */
input[type="radio"]:checked + label {
  background: #333;
}
```

### Slider Components Explained

#### Slider Container

- `.slider`: This class defines the overall container for the image slider. By setting the position to relative, it allows child elements (like the navigation dots) to be positioned in relation to it.
- `overflow: hidden;`: Prevents images from being displayed outside the boundaries of the slider.

#### Radio Buttons

- `input[type="radio"]`: The radio buttons are hidden from view since they are used only to manage the image state without requiring visible input elements.

#### Image Slides

- `.slides`: This class styles the collection of images. By using `display: flex;`, all images are placed in a single row. The width is set to 500% to accommodate all five images, allowing for a smooth transition when moving between them.
- The transition property creates a smooth effect when changing images.

#### Navigation Dots

- `.navigation`: Positions the navigation dots at the bottom of the slider and centers them horizontally.
- `label`: Each dot is styled as a circle with a light gray background, and the hover state changes its background color to indicate interactivity.

**When to Use JavaScript**

JavaScript helps websites behave interactively and respond to users. For example, it can:

- **Change the page:** It can add or update content and change the look of a website.
- **Communicate with servers:** It can send and receive data, helping load new content or upload files without refreshing the page.
- **Manage cookies:** JavaScript can store small amounts of data on your device.
- **React to actions:** JavaScript can respond when you click, move the mouse, or press keys.
- **Save data locally:** It can also store information directly on your device for later use (local storage).
- **Create animations:** JavaScript can make elements move, fade, or change size to make the page more engaging.

**NOTE**

> Developer tools are vital for JavaScript development. They enable real-time debugging, allowing you to log outputs, inspect errors, and test snippets directly in the Console. The Sources panel lets you set breakpoints and analyze code execution, while the Network tab monitors API interactions, helping optimize load times. Utilizing these tools enhances your debugging capabilities and leads to more efficient, maintainable code, improving your web applications' overall quality.
