## Providers

Context providers are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to share data and functionality across components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. They enable a more efficient way to manage state and provide a way to create global state that can be accessed by any component in the application.

#### Key Features of Context Providers

- **Global State Management**: Context providers allow developers to create a global state that can be accessed by any component in the application. This eliminates the need to pass props down through multiple levels of components, making it easier to manage state and share data across the application.
- **Decoupling Components**: By using context providers, components can be decoupled from each other, allowing for better separation of concerns. This makes it easier to maintain and test components, as they no longer rely on props being passed down from parent components.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Context providers allow components to dynamically update their state based on changes in the context. This means that when the context value changes, all components that consume that context will automatically re-render with the new value, ensuring that the UI remains in sync with the underlying data.

### Example of a Context Provider

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";
// Create a context
const MyContext = createContext();
// Create a provider component
export const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState("Hello, World!");
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};
// Create a custom hook to use the context
export const useMyContext = () => {
  return useContext(MyContext);
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a context provider in React. The `MyProvider` component uses the `useState` hook to manage a piece of state (`state`) and provides it to any child components through the `MyContext.Provider`. The `useMyContext` custom hook allows components to easily access the context value.

### Using the Context Provider

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { MyProvider, useMyContext } from "./MyContext";
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { state, setState } = useMyContext();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{state}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setState("Hello, Next.js!")}>Update State</button>
    </div>
  );
};
const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <MyComponent />
    </MyProvider>
  );
};
export default App;
```

This example shows how to use the context provider in a component. The `MyComponent` uses the `useMyContext` hook to access the context value and update it when the button is clicked. The `App` component wraps `MyComponent` with the `MyProvider`, allowing it to access the context.

## When to Use Context Providers

Context providers are particularly useful when you need to share data or functionality across multiple components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. They are ideal for managing global state, such as user authentication, theming, or localization, where multiple components need access to the same data.
Context providers are particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **Global State Management**: When you need to manage global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components across different levels of the component tree, context providers can simplify this process.
- **Theming**: When you want to implement a theme that can be applied globally across your application, context providers can help manage the theme state and provide it to all components that need to access it.
- **Authentication**: When you need to manage user authentication state, such as whether a user is logged in or not, context providers can help share this state across components without having to pass it down through props.
- **Localization**: When you want to provide localization support, context providers can be used to manage the current language and provide translations to components that need them.

## Benefits of Using Context Providers

- **Simplified State Management**: Context providers simplify state management by allowing developers to create a single source of truth for their application's state. This reduces the complexity of managing state across multiple components and makes it easier to reason about the application's behavior.
- **Improved Performance**: By using context providers, components can avoid unnecessary re-renders when props change. This can lead to improved performance, especially in large applications with many components that rely on shared state.
- **Enhanced Code Readability**: Context providers promote cleaner and more readable code by reducing the need for prop drilling. This makes it easier to understand how data flows through the application and how components interact with each other.

## Examples

### Example of a Theming Context Provider

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";
// Create a context for theming
const ThemeContext = createContext();
// Create a provider component for theming
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
// Create a custom hook to use the theming context
export const useTheme = () => {
  return useContext(ThemeContext);
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a theming context provider in React. The `ThemeProvider` component manages the current theme state and provides a function to toggle between light and dark themes. The `useTheme` custom hook allows components to easily access the theme context.

```javascript
"use client";

import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";
import { JSX, ReactNode } from "react";

export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light" enableSystem={true}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

This example shows how to use the theming context provider in a component. The `useTheme` hook is used to access the current theme and the function to toggle the theme. Components can use this context to apply different styles based on the current theme.

### Not Found Context Provider

````javascript
"use client";

import { NotFoundContextType } from "@/lib/types";
import { createContext, JSX, ReactNode, useContext, useState } from "react";

const NotFoundContext =
  (createContext < NotFoundContextType) | (undefined > undefined);

/**
 * Provides a context for managing a "not found" state within the application.
 *
 * @param {Object} props - The properties object.
 * @param {ReactNode} props.children - The child components that will have access to the context.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The provider component that wraps its children with the NotFoundContext.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { NotFoundProvider } from './NotFoundContext';
 *
 * function App() {
 *   return (
 *     <NotFoundProvider>
 *       <YourComponent />
 *     </NotFoundProvider>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 */
export const NotFoundProvider = ({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode,
}): JSX.Element => {
  const [isNotFound, setIsNotFound] = useState(false);

  return (
    <NotFoundContext.Provider
      value={{ isNotFound, setNotFound: setIsNotFound }}
    >
      {children}
    </NotFoundContext.Provider>
  );
};

/**
 * Custom hook to access the NotFoundContext.
 *
 * This hook provides the current value of the NotFoundContext. It must be used
 * within a NotFoundProvider; otherwise, it will throw an error.
 *
 * @throws {Error} If the hook is used outside of a NotFoundProvider.
 * @returns {NotFoundContextType} The current context value.
 */
export const useNotFound = (): NotFoundContextType => {
  const context = useContext(NotFoundContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useNotFound must be used within a NotFoundProvider");
  }
  return context;
};
````

```typescript
export type NotFoundContextType = {
  isNotFound: boolean;
  setNotFound: (value: boolean) => void;
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a "not found" context provider in React. The `NotFoundProvider` component manages a boolean state (`isNotFound`) that indicates whether a "not found" condition exists. The `useNotFound` custom hook allows components to easily access this context and update the state when necessary.

### Example of a User Authentication Context Provider

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";
// Create a context for user authentication
const AuthContext = createContext();
// Create a provider component for user authentication
export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const login = (userData) => {
    setUser(userData);
  };
  const logout = () => {
    setUser(null);
  };
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Create a custom hook to use the authentication context
export const useAuth = () => {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a user authentication context provider in React. The `AuthProvider` component manages the current user state and provides functions to log in and log out. The `useAuth` custom hook allows components to easily access the authentication context.

```javascript
"use client";
import { AuthProvider } from "@/context/AuthContext";
import { JSX, ReactNode } from "react";
export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element {
  return <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>;
}
```

This example shows how to use the user authentication context provider in a component. The `useAuth` hook is used to access the current user and the functions to log in and log out. Components can use this context to manage user authentication state throughout the application.

```javascript
"use client";
import { useAuth } from "@/context/AuthContext";
import { useEffect } from "react";
export default function UserProfile() {
  const { user, login, logout } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate a login action
    if (!user) {
      login({ name: "John Doe", email: "johnDoe@test.com" });
    }
  }, [user, login]);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      {user ? (
        <div>
          <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
          <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example shows how to use the user authentication context in a component. The `UserProfile` component uses the `useAuth` hook to access the current user and the functions to log in and log out. It simulates a login action when the component mounts and displays the user's profile information.
