# Layouts and Pages

## Table of Contents

## Overview

In Next.js, layouts and pages are essential components that define the structure and content of your application. Layouts provide a consistent structure across multiple pages, while pages represent individual routes in your application. Understanding how to create and use layouts and pages is crucial for building scalable and maintainable Next.js applications.

## Creating Pages

When creating pages in Next.js, you define a React component that represents the content of the page. The process is very similar to creating a layout, but the component is placed in the `pages` directory or the `app` directory in the new Next.js 13+ structure.

The file structure determines the route of the page. For example, if you create a file named `about.js` in the `pages` directory, it will be accessible at the `/about` route.

#### File Structure Example foi `pages` Directory

```plaintext
pages/
 ├── index.js        // Home page
 ├── about.js        // About page
 ├── contact.js      // Contact page
 └── blog/
     ├── index.js    // Blog index page
     └──  [slug].js   // Dynamic blog post page
```

In this example, the `index.js` file represents the home page, while the `about.js` and `contact.js` files represent individual pages. The `blog` directory contains a dynamic route `[slug].js`, which allows you to create pages for individual blog posts based on their slugs.

#### File Structure Example for `app` Directory

```plaintext
app/
 ├── layout.js        // Global layout
 ├── page.js          // Home page
 ├── about/
     └──  page.js      // About page
 └──  blog/
     ├── page.js      // Blog index page
     └──  [slug]/
         └──  page.js  // Dynamic blog post page
```

In this example, the `layout.js` file defines a global layout that can be used across all pages. The `page.js` files represent individual pages, and the `[slug]/page.js` file represents a dynamic route for blog posts.

Within these page components, you can fetch data, render content, and use any React features to build your pages. For example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page of our Next.js application.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This `AboutPage` component represents the content of the about page. You can add more complex logic, such as fetching data from an API or using state management libraries, to enhance the functionality of your pages.

## Creating Layouts

Layouts in Next.js allow you to define a common structure for your pages, such as headers, footers, and sidebars. This helps maintain a consistent look and feel across your application. You can create a layout by defining a React component that wraps your page content.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Sidebar from "@/components/Sidebar";
import MainContent from "@/components/MainContent";
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-layout">
      <Sidebar />
      <MainContent>{children}</MainContent>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This layout component can be used in your pages to provide a consistent structure. You can also pass props to the layout component to customize its behavior or appearance.

In this example, the `Layout` component includes a `Sidebar` and a `MainContent` component, which will be rendered alongside the page content. The `children` prop represents the content of the page that will be displayed within the layout.
You can also create nested layouts by defining multiple layout components and using them in different parts of your application. This allows for more complex structures, such as having a different layout for admin pages compared to public pages.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import AdminSidebar from "@/components/AdminSidebar";
import AdminMainContent from "@/components/AdminMainContent";
export default function AdminLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="admin-layout">
      <AdminSidebar />
      <AdminMainContent>{children}</AdminMainContent>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using Layouts with Pages

To use layouts with pages in Next.js, you can wrap your page components with the layout component. This allows you to apply the layout structure to multiple pages without duplicating code.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Layout from "@/components/Layout";
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Welcome to Our Next.js Application</h1>
      <p>This is the home page content.</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

### Nested Layouts

You can also create nested layouts by defining multiple layout components and using them in different parts of your application. This allows for more complex structures, such as having a different layout for admin pages compared to public pages.

The file structure for nested layouts might look like this:

```plaintext
app/
 ├── layout.js        // Global layout
 ├── admin/
     ├── layout.js    // Admin layout
     └──  page.js      // Admin page
 └──  public/
     └──  page.js      // Public page
```

In this example, the `admin/layout.js` file defines a layout specifically for admin pages, while the `public/page.js` file uses the global layout defined in `layout.js`. This allows you to maintain a clean separation of concerns and apply different layouts to different parts of your application.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import AdminLayout from "@/components/AdminLayout";
export default function AdminPage() {
  return (
    <AdminLayout>
      <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
      <p>This is the admin page content.</p>
    </AdminLayout>
  );
}
```

This `AdminPage` component uses the `AdminLayout`, which provides a different structure for admin pages compared to the public pages. This approach allows you to maintain a clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage different layouts for various parts of your application.
