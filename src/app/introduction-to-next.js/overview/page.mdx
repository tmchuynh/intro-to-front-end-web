## Overview

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications with ease. It provides a robust set of features, including automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. Next.js simplifies the development process by allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows developers to render pages on the server, providing better performance and SEO benefits. This means that the initial HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client, reducing the time it takes for the page to load and improving search engine visibility.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Next.js supports static site generation, allowing developers to pre-render pages at build time. This results in faster page loads and improved performance, as the pages are served as static files. SSG is particularly useful for content-heavy sites where the content does not change frequently.
- **API Routes**: Next.js provides a simple way to create API routes, allowing developers to build backend functionality directly within their Next.js application. This eliminates the need for a separate backend server, making it easier to manage and deploy the application as a single unit.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits the code into smaller chunks, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded for each page. This improves performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed on the client side.
- **File-Based Routing**: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where the file structure in the `app` directory determines the routes of the application. This makes it easy to create and manage routes without having to configure a separate routing library. Each file in the `app` directory corresponds to a route in the application, and Next.js automatically handles the routing logic.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Next.js supports CSS and Sass out of the box, allowing developers to style their applications using familiar CSS syntax. This makes it easy to create visually appealing applications without having to set up additional tooling.

## Getting Started

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new Next.js application using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This command will create a new Next.js application in a directory named `my-next-app`. You can then navigate to the directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can begin building your Next.js application by creating pages, components, and API routes.
