# Next.js

## Table of Contents

## Overview

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications with ease. It provides a robust set of features, including automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. Next.js simplifies the development process by allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows developers to render pages on the server, providing better performance and SEO benefits. This means that the initial HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client, reducing the time it takes for the page to load and improving search engine visibility.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Next.js supports static site generation, allowing developers to pre-render pages at build time. This results in faster page loads and improved performance, as the pages are served as static files. SSG is particularly useful for content-heavy sites where the content does not change frequently.
- **API Routes**: Next.js provides a simple way to create API routes, allowing developers to build backend functionality directly within their Next.js application. This eliminates the need for a separate backend server, making it easier to manage and deploy the application as a single unit.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits the code into smaller chunks, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded for each page. This improves performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed on the client side.
- **File-Based Routing**: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where the file structure in the `app` directory determines the routes of the application. This makes it easy to create and manage routes without having to configure a separate routing library. Each file in the `app` directory corresponds to a route in the application, and Next.js automatically handles the routing logic.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Next.js supports CSS and Sass out of the box, allowing developers to style their applications using familiar CSS syntax. This makes it easy to create visually appealing applications without having to set up additional tooling.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new Next.js application using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This command will create a new Next.js application in a directory named `my-next-app`. You can then navigate to the directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can begin building your Next.js application by creating pages, components, and API routes.

## Configurations

### `next.config.js`

Next.js provides a `next.config.js` file where you can customize various aspects of your application, such as environment variables, custom webpack configurations, and more. This file allows you to tailor the behavior of Next.js to suit your specific needs.

#### Example of `next.config.js`

```javascript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const imageHosts = [
  "images.unsplash.com",
  "tailwindcss.com",
  "plus.unsplash.com",
  "source.unsplash.com",
  "img.freepik.com",
  "rainn.org",
  "media.istockphoto.com",
  "cdn.pixabay.com",
  "lh3.googleusercontent.com",
  "randomuser.me",
  "s3.amazonaws.com",
  "avatars.githubusercontent.com",
  "cdn.jsdelivr.net",
];

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: imageHosts.map((hostname) => ({
      protocol: "https",
      hostname,
      port: "",
      pathname: "/**",
    })),
    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

This example demonstrates how to configure Next.js to allow images from specific remote hosts. The `remotePatterns` option specifies the allowed hosts, and the `dangerouslyAllowSVG` option enables support for SVG images. You can customize this configuration based on your application's requirements.

### `tsconfig.json`

If you are using TypeScript in your Next.js application, you will have a `tsconfig.json` file that contains TypeScript compiler options and configurations. This file helps define the behavior of TypeScript in your project, such as module resolution, strict type checking, and other compiler options.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"],
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@ui/*": ["src/components/ui/*"],
      "@lib/*": ["src/lib/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/lib/utils/*"],
      "@config/*": ["src/lib/config/*"],
      "@context/*": ["src/context/*"],
      "@constants/*": ["src/lib/constants/*"],
      "@interfaces/*": ["src/lib/interfaces/*"],
      "@types/*": ["src/lib/types/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["src/hooks/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

This `tsconfig.json` file includes various compiler options that enhance the development experience, such as strict type checking, module resolution, and support for JSX. The `paths` option allows you to create aliases for directories, making it easier to import modules throughout your application.

### `eslint.config.js`

Next.js also supports ESLint for linting your code. You can create an `eslint.config.js` file to define your ESLint configuration. This file allows you to specify rules, plugins, and other settings for linting your Next.js application.

```javascript
import { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";
import { dirname } from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

const compat = new FlatCompat({
  baseDirectory: __dirname,
});

const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
  {
    rules: {
      "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "off",
      "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
      "no-unused-vars": "off",
    },
  },
];

export default eslintConfig;
```

This example shows how to configure ESLint for a Next.js application. The `extends` option includes the recommended rules for Next.js and TypeScript, while the `rules` section allows you to customize specific linting rules based on your project's requirements.
