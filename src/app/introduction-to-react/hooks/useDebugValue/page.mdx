# useDebugValue

## Table of Contents

## Overview

useDebugValue is a React hook that allows you to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools. It is primarily used for debugging purposes, helping developers understand the state and behavior of custom hooks.
It can be particularly useful when you have complex custom hooks that manage state or perform side effects, as it provides a way to visualize their current state in the React DevTools.

#### Benefits of using `useDebugValue`:

- **Improved Debugging**: It helps you see the state of custom hooks in React DevTools, making it easier to debug complex applications.
- **Clarity**: It provides a clear label for custom hooks, making it easier to identify them in the DevTools.
- **Customizable**: You can format the debug value to display relevant information about the hook's state or behavior.
- **Performance Monitoring**: It can be used to monitor the performance of custom hooks by displaying relevant metrics in React DevTools.
- **Error Handling**: It allows you to display error messages or statuses related to the custom hook in the DevTools.
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: It can help track the lifecycle of custom hooks in React DevTools, providing insights into when they are mounted, updated, or unmounted.
- **Contextual Information**: It provides additional context or information about the custom hook's state, which can be useful for understanding its behavior during development.
- **Visual Representation**: It allows you to visualize the current state of complex custom hooks in the DevTools, making it easier to understand their behavior.
- **Labeling**: It provides a label that describes the custom hook's purpose or functionality, making it easier to identify in the DevTools.
- **Status Monitoring**: It can be used to monitor the status of asynchronous operations performed by custom hooks, such as loading, error, or success states.

#### When to use `useDebugValue`:

- When you have custom hooks that manage state or perform side effects.
- When you want to improve the debugging experience in React DevTools.
- When you want to provide additional context or information about the custom hook's state.
- When you want to visualize the current state of complex custom hooks in the DevTools.
- When you want to monitor the performance or behavior of custom hooks during development.
- When you want to display error messages or statuses related to the custom hook in the DevTools.
- When you want to provide a label that describes the custom hook's purpose or functionality.
- When you want to track the lifecycle of custom hooks in React DevTools.

## Common Use Cases

- **Custom Hooks**: Use `useDebugValue` in custom hooks to provide a label that describes the hook's state or behavior.
- **Complex State Management**: When managing complex state in custom hooks, use `useDebugValue` to display the current state in React DevTools.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: If your custom hook performs asynchronous operations, use `useDebugValue` to show the current status (e.g., loading, error, success) in the DevTools.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use `useDebugValue` to monitor the performance of custom hooks by displaying relevant metrics in React DevTools.
- **Error Handling**: When your custom hook handles errors, use `useDebugValue` to display error messages or statuses in the DevTools.

## How It Works

The `useDebugValue` hook takes a value as an argument and displays it in React DevTools. You can also provide a formatting function to customize how the value is displayed. The value can be a simple string, an object, or any other data type that you want to visualize in the DevTools.

### Initialization

```javascript
import { useDebugValue } from "react";
function useCustomHook(value) {
  // Use useDebugValue to display the value in React DevTools
  useDebugValue(value);

  // Custom hook logic here
  return value;
}
```

### Parameters

- `value`: The value you want to display in React DevTools. This can be a string, object, or any other data type.
- `format`: An optional formatting function that takes the value and returns a formatted string for display in the DevTools.

### Execution

When the component using the custom hook is rendered, `useDebugValue` will display the provided value in React DevTools under the custom hook's name. If a formatting function is provided, it will be used to format the value before displaying it.

## What to Avoid

- Avoid using `useDebugValue` in components that do not use custom hooks, as it is specifically designed for custom hooks.
- Avoid using `useDebugValue` in performance-critical paths, as it may introduce a slight overhead due to the additional rendering in React DevTools.
- Avoid using `useDebugValue` for values that are not relevant for debugging, as it may clutter the React DevTools with unnecessary information.

## Examples

```javascript
import { useDebugValue, useState } from "react";
function useCustomHook() {
  const [state, setState] = useState("Initial State");
  // Use useDebugValue to display the current state in React DevTools
  useDebugValue(state, (value) => `Current State: ${value}`);
  return [state, setState];
}
```

```javascript
import { useDebugValue, useState } from "react";
function useAsyncData() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  // Use useDebugValue to display the loading status in React DevTools
  useDebugValue(
    loading ? "Loading..." : error ? `Error: ${error}` : "Data Loaded"
  );
  return { data, loading, error, setData };
}
```
