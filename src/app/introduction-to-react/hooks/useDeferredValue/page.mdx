# useDeferedValue

## Table of Contents

## Overview

`useDeferredValue` is a React hook that allows you to defer the update of a value until after the browser has had a chance to paint. This can be useful for improving performance in certain scenarios, such as when you have a large list of items that need to be rendered.

#### Benefits of using `useDeferredValue`:

- **Performance**: It helps to avoid blocking the main thread, allowing the browser to render updates more smoothly.
- **User Experience**: It can improve the responsiveness of your application by deferring updates until after the browser has painted.
- **Reduced Jank**: It helps to reduce jank in your application by deferring updates that may cause layout shifts or reflows.
- **Optimized Rendering**: It allows you to optimize rendering performance by deferring updates that are not immediately necessary.
- **Asynchronous Updates**: It enables asynchronous updates to the state, allowing the browser to handle other tasks in the meantime.
- **Batching Updates**: It can help batch updates to the state, reducing the number of re-renders and improving performance.
- **Improved Animations**: It can enhance animations by deferring updates that may interfere with smooth transitions.
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: It can help reduce CPU usage by deferring updates that are not critical to the user experience.
- **Better Resource Management**: It allows for better resource management by deferring updates that may not be immediately necessary.

#### When to use `useDeferredValue`:

- When you have a large list of items that need to be rendered.
- When you want to improve the performance of your application by deferring updates until after the browser has painted.
- When you want to reduce jank in your application by deferring updates that may cause layout shifts or reflows.
- When you want to optimize rendering performance by deferring updates that are not immediately necessary.
- When you want to enable asynchronous updates to the state, allowing the browser to handle other tasks in the meantime.
- When you want to batch updates to the state, reducing the number of re-renders and improving performance.
- When you want to enhance animations by deferring updates that may interfere with smooth transitions.
- When you want to reduce CPU usage by deferring updates that are not critical to the user experience.
- When you want to manage resources better by deferring updates that may not be immediately necessary.

## Common Use Cases

- **Large Lists**: Use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates when rendering large lists of items, such as in a table or a grid.
- **Search Inputs**: When implementing search functionality, use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates to the search results until after the user has finished typing.
- **Form Inputs**: Use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates to form inputs, especially when dealing with complex validation or calculations that may block the main thread.
- **Animations**: When implementing animations, use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates that may interfere with smooth transitions, such as updating the position of an animated element.
- **Data Fetching**: Use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates when fetching data from an API, allowing the browser to handle other tasks in the meantime.
- **Complex Calculations**: When performing complex calculations that may block the main thread, use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates until after the browser has painted.
- **Real-time Updates**: Use `useDeferredValue` to defer updates when receiving real-time data, such as WebSocket messages, allowing the browser to handle other tasks in the meantime.

## How It Works

The `useDeferredValue` hook takes a value as an argument and returns a deferred version of that value. When the value changes, the hook will defer the update until after the browser has had a chance to paint. This means that the update will not block the main thread, allowing the browser to render updates more smoothly.

### Initialization

```javascript
import { useDeferredValue } from "react";
function MyComponent({ value }) {
  // Use useDeferredValue to defer the update of the value
  const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Original Value: {value}</p>
      <p>Deferred Value: {deferredValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Parameters

- `value`: The value you want to defer. This can be any data type, such as a string, number, or object.
- `options`: An optional object that can contain additional options for the deferred value, such as a custom comparison function.

### Execution

When the component using `useDeferredValue` is rendered, the hook will return a deferred version of the value. If the value changes, the hook will defer the update until after the browser has painted. This allows the browser to handle other tasks in the meantime, improving performance and user experience.

## What to Avoid

- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` for values that do not require deferring, as it may introduce unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` in performance-critical paths, as it may introduce a slight overhead due to the deferred updates.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` for values that need to be updated immediately, as it may delay the update and cause a poor user experience.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` in components that do not require deferring, as it may clutter the code and make it harder to read.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` for values that are not expected to change frequently, as it may introduce unnecessary complexity without providing significant benefits.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` in scenarios where immediate updates are critical, such as in real-time applications or interactive user interfaces.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` in components that do not require deferred updates, as it may lead to confusion and make the code harder to maintain.
- Avoid using `useDeferredValue` for values that are not performance-sensitive, as it may introduce unnecessary complexity without providing significant benefits.

## Examples

### Basic Example

```javascript
import { useDeferredValue, useState } from "react";
function MyComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Initial Value");
  // Use useDeferredValue to defer the update of the value
  const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>Original Value: {value}</p>
      <p>Deferred Value: {deferredValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Large List Example
```javascript
import { useDeferredValue, useState } from "react";
function LargeList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => `Item ${i + 1}`));
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
  // Use useDeferredValue to defer the update of the search term
  const deferredSearchTerm = useDeferredValue(searchTerm);
  const filteredItems = items.filter(item => item.toLowerCase().includes(deferredSearchTerm.toLowerCase()));
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search items..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredItems.map(item => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
}
```
