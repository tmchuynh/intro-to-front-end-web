# useId

## Table of Contents

## Overview

The `useId` hook is a React hook that generates a unique ID for each component instance. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes, such as associating labels with form elements.
It ensures that IDs are stable across server and client renders, which is important for server-side rendering (SSR) scenarios.

#### Benefits of `useId`:

- **Unique IDs**: Generates unique IDs that can be used for form elements, ARIA attributes, and other elements that require unique identification.
- **Stable Across Renders**: The IDs generated by `useId` are stable across server and client renders, ensuring consistency in the DOM.
- **Accessibility**: Helps improve accessibility by providing unique identifiers for elements, which can be referenced by labels and other attributes.

#### When to Use `useId`:

- When you need to generate unique IDs for form elements, such as input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- When you need to associate labels with form elements using the `htmlFor` attribute.
- When you need to generate unique IDs for ARIA attributes, such as `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`.
- When you want to ensure that IDs are stable across server and client renders, especially in server-side rendering (SSR) scenarios.

## Common Use Cases

- **Form Elements**: Use `useId` to generate unique IDs for input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons to ensure proper association with labels.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Use `useId` to generate unique IDs for ARIA attributes, such as `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`, to improve accessibility.
- **Dynamic Components**: Use `useId` in dynamic components where unique IDs are required for elements that may be rendered conditionally or in loops.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Use `useId` to ensure that IDs are stable across server and client renders, preventing mismatches in the DOM during hydration.

## How It Works

The `useId` hook generates a unique ID for each component instance. When the component is rendered, it returns a stable ID that can be used for various purposes, such as associating labels with form elements or generating ARIA attributes.

```javascript
import { useId } from "react";
function MyComponent() {
  // Use useId to generate a unique ID
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Input Label</label>
      <input id={id} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, the `useId` hook generates a unique ID that is used for both the label and the input field. This ensures that the label is correctly associated with the input, improving accessibility.

## What to Avoid

- **Avoid Hardcoding IDs**: Do not hardcode IDs in your components, as this can lead to conflicts and accessibility issues. Always use `useId` to generate unique IDs.
- **Avoid Using IDs for Styling**: Do not use IDs for styling purposes, as this can lead to specificity issues in CSS. Instead, use classes or other selectors for styling.
- **Avoid Using IDs in Loops**: Do not use `useId` in loops or conditional rendering without ensuring that the IDs are unique for each instance. This can lead to duplicate IDs in the DOM.
- **Avoid Mixing Server and Client IDs**: Do not mix IDs generated on the server with those generated on the client. Always use `useId` to ensure that IDs are consistent across server and client renders.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { useId } from "react";
function FormComponent() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Name:</label>
      <input id={id} type="text" />
      <label htmlFor={`${id}-email`}>Email:</label>
      <input id={`${id}-email`} type="email" />
      <label htmlFor={`${id}-password`}>Password:</label>
      <input id={`${id}-password`} type="password" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

### ARIA Attributes

```javascript
import { useId } from "react";
function AccessibleComponent() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2 id={id}>Section Title</h2>
      <p aria-labelledby={id}>This section is labeled by the heading above.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Use `useId` for Unique IDs**: Always use the `useId` hook to generate unique IDs for form elements, ARIA attributes, and other elements that require unique identification.
- **Ensure Stability Across Renders**: Use `useId` to ensure that IDs are stable across server and client renders, especially in server-side rendering (SSR) scenarios.
- **Follow Accessibility Guidelines**: Use unique IDs to improve accessibility by associating labels with form elements and using ARIA attributes correctly.
- **Avoid Hardcoding IDs**: Do not hardcode IDs in your components. Always use `useId` to generate unique IDs dynamically.
- **Test Accessibility**: Regularly test your components for accessibility to ensure that unique IDs are correctly associated with labels and ARIA attributes.
- **Document Usage**: Document the usage of `useId` in your components to help other developers understand its purpose and benefits.
