# useMemo

## Table of Contents

## Overview

useMemo is a React hook that allows you to optimize performance by memoizing the result of a computation. It is particularly useful when you have expensive calculations that do not need to be recalculated on every render, but only when specific dependencies change.
It helps to avoid unnecessary re-computations and can improve the performance of your application, especially in cases where the computation is resource-intensive.

#### Benefits of using `useMemo`:

- **Performance Optimization**: It prevents expensive calculations from being executed on every render, which can lead to significant performance improvements.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders**: By memoizing the result, it helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on the computed value.
- **Improved User Experience**: By reducing the computational overhead, it can lead to a smoother user experience, especially in applications with complex UI interactions or large datasets.

#### When to Use `useMemo`:

- When you have expensive calculations that do not need to be recalculated on every render.
- When you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on the computed value.
- When you want to optimize performance in scenarios where the computation is resource-intensive.

## Common Use Cases

- **Expensive Calculations**: When you have calculations that are computationally expensive and do not need to be recalculated on every render, such as filtering or sorting large datasets.
- **Derived State**: When you need to derive state from props or other state variables, and you want to avoid recalculating it on every render.
- **Memoizing Component Props**: When you want to memoize the props passed to a child component to prevent unnecessary re-renders of that component.
- **Optimizing Rendering Performance**: When you want to optimize the rendering performance of a component by memoizing the result of a computation that is used in the render method.

### Syntax

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
const MyComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive calculation
    return data.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
  }, [data]); // Dependencies array

  return <div>{computedValue}</div>;
};
```

### Parameters

- `create`: A function that returns the computed value. This function will be executed only when the dependencies change.
- `dependencies`: An array of dependencies that determine when the memoized value should be recalculated. If any of the dependencies change, the `create` function will be executed again to recalculate the memoized value. If the dependencies do not change, the previously memoized value will be returned.

## How It Works

### Initial Render

When the component is first rendered, the `useMemo` hook is called with the `create` function and the `dependencies` array. The `create` function is executed, and the result is memoized. This memoized value is then returned by the `useMemo` hook.

### Updates

On subsequent renders, the `useMemo` hook checks the `dependencies` array. If any of the dependencies have changed since the last render, the `create` function is executed again to recalculate the memoized value. If the dependencies have not changed, the previously memoized value is returned, avoiding the need to re-execute the `create` function.

### What Happens on Re-renders

When the component re-renders, the `useMemo` hook checks the dependencies array. If any of the dependencies have changed, the `create` function is executed again to recalculate the memoized value. If the dependencies have not changed, the previously memoized value is returned, preventing unnecessary re-computation and improving performance.

## What to Avoid

- **Avoid Overusing `useMemo`**: While `useMemo` can improve performance, it should not be used excessively. Overusing it can lead to unnecessary complexity and make the code harder to read and maintain.
- **Avoid Using `useMemo` for Simple Calculations**: If the calculation is simple and does not involve expensive computations, using `useMemo` may not provide significant performance benefits. In such cases, it is better to rely on React's built-in optimizations.
- **Avoid Using `useMemo` for Side Effects**: `useMemo` is intended for memoizing values, not for managing side effects. If you need to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM, use the `useEffect` hook instead.

## Examples

### Memoizing an Expensive Calculation

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
const ExpensiveCalculationComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    // Simulating an expensive calculation
    return data.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
  }, [data]); // Only recalculate when 'data' changes
  return <div>Computed Value: {computedValue}</div>;
};
export default ExpensiveCalculationComponent;
```

### Memoizing Component Props

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered");
  return <div>Value: {value}</div>;
});
const ParentComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
    return data.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
  }, [data]); // Only recalculate when 'data' changes
  return <ChildComponent value={memoizedValue} />;
};
export default ParentComponent;
```

## Best Practices

- **Use `useMemo` Sparingly**: Only use `useMemo` for expensive calculations or when you need to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Overusing it can lead to code complexity.
- **Keep Dependencies Accurate**: Ensure that the dependencies array is accurate. If you forget to include a dependency, the memoized value may not update when it should, leading to stale data.
- **Avoid Side Effects**: Do not use `useMemo` for side effects. It is meant for memoizing values, not for managing side effects. Use `useEffect` for side effects instead.
- **Profile Performance**: Use React's performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your application. Only use `useMemo` when it provides a measurable performance improvement.
