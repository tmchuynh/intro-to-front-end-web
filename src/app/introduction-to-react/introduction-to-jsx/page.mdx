# Introduction to JSX

## Table of Contents

## Overview

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It is commonly used in React to describe the UI structure and components. JSX makes it easier to visualize the component hierarchy and how different elements are rendered.

JSX is not required to use React, but it is highly recommended as it improves readability and maintainability of your code. JSX is transpiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel, which converts the JSX syntax into standard JavaScript function calls.

## Basic Syntax

JSX syntax resembles HTML, but it has some differences. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- JSX elements are written within angle brackets, similar to HTML tags.
- JSX elements can be self-closing, like `<img />` or `<input />`.
- JSX attributes are written in camelCase, such as `className` instead of `class`, and `htmlFor` instead of `for`.
- JavaScript expressions can be embedded within JSX using curly braces `{}`. This allows you to dynamically render values, call functions, or perform calculations.

```javascript
import React from "react";
function MyComponent() {
  const name = "John";
  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function returns a JSX element that renders a `div` with a greeting message. The `name` variable is embedded within the JSX using curly braces, allowing it to be dynamically rendered.

## Nesting Elements

JSX allows you to nest elements within each other, just like in HTML. You can create complex UIs by combining multiple JSX elements together. Here’s an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Component</h1>
      <p>This is a simple example of JSX.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function returns a `div` that contains an `h1` heading, a paragraph, and an unordered list. The JSX syntax allows you to structure your UI in a clear and readable way.

## Conditional Rendering

JSX supports conditional rendering, allowing you to display different content based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript expressions within curly braces to achieve this. Here’s an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>{isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in.</h1>}</div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function takes a prop called `isLoggedIn`. If `isLoggedIn` is true, it renders a welcome message; otherwise, it prompts the user to log in. The conditional rendering is done using the ternary operator within the JSX.

## Styling JSX

JSX elements can be styled using inline styles or CSS classes. Inline styles are specified using the `style` attribute, which accepts a JavaScript object with camelCase properties. Here’s an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
function MyComponent() {
  const style = {
    color: "blue",
    fontSize: "20px",
  };
  return <div style={style}>This text is styled with inline styles.</div>;
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function returns a `div` with inline styles applied to it. The `style` object contains properties like `color` and `fontSize`, which are written in camelCase.

You can also use CSS classes to style JSX elements. To apply a class, use the `className` attribute instead of `class`:

```css
/* styles.css */
.my-class {
  color: red;
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./styles.css"; // Import the CSS file
function MyComponent() {
  return <div className="my-class">This text is styled with a CSS class.</div>;
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function returns a `div` with a CSS class applied to it. The `className` attribute is used to specify the class name, which can be defined in an external CSS file.
