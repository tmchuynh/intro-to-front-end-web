# Component Libraries

## Table of Contents

## What and Why

Component libraries are collections of pre-built components that can be reused across different parts of an application. They help in maintaining consistency, speeding up development, and improving the overall user experience. By using a component library, developers can focus on building features rather than creating UI components from scratch. These libraries often come with a set of design guidelines and best practices, ensuring that the components are not only functional but also visually appealing and accessible.
