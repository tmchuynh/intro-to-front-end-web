## Table of Contents

## What and Why

Icon libraries are collections of pre-designed icons that can be easily integrated into web applications. They provide a wide range of icons for various purposes, such as navigation, actions, and branding. By using icon libraries, developers can enhance the visual appeal of their applications and improve user experience without the need to create custom icons from scratch.

Icon libraries are particularly useful because they offer a consistent design language and style, making it easier to maintain a cohesive look across the application. They also save time and effort, as developers can quickly find and implement icons that suit their needs without having to design them individually.

These libraries often include features such as:

- **Scalability**: Icons can be easily resized without losing quality, making them suitable for different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Customizability**: Many icon libraries allow developers to customize the color, size, and style of icons to match the application's design.
- **Accessibility**: Icons are designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that they can be used effectively by all users, including those with visual impairments.
- **Performance**: Icon libraries are optimized for performance, ensuring that icons load quickly and do not negatively impact the application's performance.
- **Integration with React**: Many icon libraries provide React components, making it easy to use icons within React applications.
