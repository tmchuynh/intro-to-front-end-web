## Table of Contents

## Introduction to NPM and Yarn

A **package manager** is like your project's personal concierge – handling dependencies, fetching libraries, and keeping everything organized and up to date so you don't have to. By automating the installation and management of external tools, it smooths out the development process and ensures your workflow stays efficient.

Take **npm (Node Package Manager)** for example. Think of it as your reliable coding sidekick that fetches packages (ready-to-use chunks of code) straight from the command line – kind of like summoning your project's magic ingredients with a few keystrokes. On the other hand, we have **Yarn**, a creation from Facebook's labs. The name cleverly stands for **"Yet Another Resource Negotiator,"** and it tackles some of npm's quirks, delivering faster performance and a sprinkle of extra security.

Both npm and Yarn work behind the scenes, simplifying your coding life by managing the nitty-gritty for you. Whether you choose npm or Yarn, you'll be equipped with a trusty tool that keeps your coding workflow smooth and stress-free, leaving you more time to actually build cool things.

### NPM

npm is the world's largest software registry and is included with Node.js. It's free, open-source, and uses **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** for package management. npm main job is to handle dependencies and packages automatically, making **Node.js** development smoother and more efficient by allowing you to install only the modules you need. Its benefits include:

- **Ease of Use**: Simple for developers to manage and use.

- **Faster Development**: Reduces the time needed to set up and manage dependencies

- **Local Installation**: Saves space by installing packages only where needed.

npm is included with Node.js, making it readily accessible. However, different projects may require different versions of Node, and using an incompatible version can lead to errors and project failures. Ensure you are using the correct version for each project to maintain functionality.

### Nvm

Picture this: You're knee-deep in a project that demands Node 12.0.0, but your system's stuck on the ancient 10.0.0. It's like a superhero struggling with powers they can't control—frustrating and chaotic. Upgrade to 12.0.0 to save the day, only to wreck older projects still clinging to 10.0.0. Talk about a domino effect of disaster.

Enter nvm (Node Version Manager), the sleek sidekick you didn't know you needed. Forget the hassle of manually juggling Node versions—nvm lets you switch effortlessly with a single command. It keeps each project running the right Node version, turning your workflow from chaotic to classy. Say goodbye to version nightmares and hello to smooth, organized efficiency. Because managing Node versions shouldn't feel like a supervillain plot.

nvm keeps your projects happy, your errors to a minimum, and your life a lot easier.

### Yarn

Yarn is a modern package manager for Node.js, developed by Facebook, Exponent, Google, and Tilde, and is distributed under the BSD license.

Developers often switch to Yarn for its stability. Unlike npm, which may lead to inconsistencies in package versions when deploying across different machines, Yarn addresses this issue effectively.

The key benefits of Yarn include:

- **Active Community**: Yarn has a vibrant and supportive user community.

- **Local Cache Installation**: Yarn can install packages from the local cache, speeding up the process.

- **Parallel Installation**: Yarn installs packages in parallel, which is faster than npm's sequential installation.

- **Version Binding**: It strongly binds package versions, ensuring consistency.

Yarn needs to be installed explicitly by running `npm install -g yarn` to install it globally.

Running `yarn set version latest` will update to the latest version.

With Yarn, it is possible to use different versions for each project similar to using nvm for npm. Except with Yarn you would only need to run `yarn set version <version>` to change the version. No need to install a version manager.

| List installed packages    | `npm list`                 | `yarn list`                 |
| Initialize a project       | `npm init`                 | `yarn init`                 |
| Install all dependencies   | `npm install`              | `yarn install`              |
| Run a script               | `npm run <script>`         | `yarn <script>`             |

### Differences in Features

While npm and Yarn share many similarities, they also have distinct features that set them apart:

| Feature               | npm                 | Yarn                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Package Locking       | `package-lock.json` | `yarn.lock`              |
| Offline Mode          | Limited support     | Full offline mode        |
| Parallel Installation | ❌                  | ✅                       |
| Security Checks       | Basic               | Enhanced security checks |
| Workspaces            | Limited support     | Full support             |

### Package Locking

Both npm and Yarn use lock files to ensure consistent installations across different environments. npm uses `package-lock.json`, while Yarn uses `yarn.lock`. These files record the exact versions of dependencies installed, preventing unexpected changes when running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### Offline Mode

Yarn has a robust offline mode that allows developers to install packages without an internet connection, as it caches packages locally. This is particularly useful for developers who work in environments with limited or no internet access. npm has limited offline support, but it does not cache packages as extensively as Yarn.

### Parallel Installation

Yarn installs packages in parallel, which significantly speeds up the installation process compared to npm's sequential installation. This means that Yarn can handle multiple package installations simultaneously, making it more efficient for larger projects with many dependencies. npm has made improvements in recent versions, but Yarn still maintains an edge in this area.

### Security Checks

Yarn includes built-in security checks that are more rigorous than npm's standard practices. While npm does offer some security features, it allows packages to execute code during installation, which can expose your project to potential risks. Yarn enforces stricter measures to ensure that only safe packages are installed, enhancing the overall security of your development environment.

### Workspaces

Yarn supports workspaces, allowing developers to manage multiple packages within a single repository. This is particularly useful for monorepos, where multiple related projects share dependencies. npm has limited support for workspaces, but Yarn's implementation is more robust and user-friendly. Workspaces enable developers to easily manage dependencies across multiple packages, making it easier to maintain large codebases.

### Performance: Who's Faster?

When it comes to speed, Yarn excels with its ability to install packages in parallel, making the process much faster than npm, which installs packages sequentially. This parallel installation is like juggling multiple tasks at once, resulting in a more efficient workflow. However, npm has made significant improvements in its recent versions and is now quite fast as well. For developers who prioritize speed, Yarn's efficiency can be a crucial advantage.

### Security Considerations

Yarn includes built-in security checks that are more rigorous than standard practices. While npm does offer some security features, it permits packages to execute code during installation, which can expose your project to potential risks. In contrast, Yarn enforces stricter measures to ensure that only safe packages are installed, enhancing the overall security of your development environment.

## NPM

npm is the world's largest software registry and is included with Node.js. It's free, open-source, and uses **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** for package management. npm's main job is to handle dependencies and packages automatically, making **Node.js** development smoother and more efficient by allowing you to install only the modules you need. Its benefits include:

- **Ease of Use**: Simple for developers to manage and use.
- **Faster Development**: Reduces the time needed to set up and manage dependencies.
- **Local Installation**: Saves space by installing packages only where needed.
  npm is included with Node.js, making it readily accessible. However, different projects may require different versions of Node, and using an incompatible version can lead to errors and project failures. Ensure you are using the correct version for each project to maintain functionality.

### Installing NPM

To install npm, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. npm comes bundled with Node.js, so when you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed as well. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Initializing a Project with NPM

To start a new Node.js project, you can use the following command to create a `package.json` file, which will hold information about your project and its dependencies:

```bash
npm init
```

This command will prompt you to enter details about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, and more. After answering the prompts, a `package.json` file will be created in your project directory.

### Installing Packages with NPM

To install a package using npm, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

This command will download the specified package and its dependencies, placing them in the `node_modules` directory within your project. If you want to install a package globally (making it available system-wide), you can use the `-g` flag:

```bash
npm install -g <package-name>
```

### Managing Dependencies

npm allows you to manage your project's dependencies easily. You can specify which packages your project depends on in the `package.json` file. When you run `npm install`, npm will read this file and install all the listed dependencies automatically.

You can also specify different types of dependencies, such as:

- **Dependencies**: Packages required for your project to run in production.
- **DevDependencies**: Packages needed only for development and testing purposes.

### Uninstalling Packages

To remove a package from your project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

This command will remove the specified package from the `node_modules` directory and update the `package.json` file accordingly. If you want to uninstall a package globally, you can use the `-g` flag:

```bash
npm uninstall -g <package-name>
```

### Updating Packages

To update a package to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm update <package-name>
```

This command will check for the latest version of the specified package and update it if a newer version is available. If you want to update all packages in your project, you can simply run:

```bash
npm update
```

This will update all dependencies listed in your `package.json` file to their latest compatible versions.

### Running Scripts

npm allows you to define scripts in your `package.json` file that can be executed using the `npm run` command. For example, you can define a script to start your application or run tests. Here's an example of how to define a script in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

You can then run these scripts using the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
npm run test
```

### Publishing Packages

If you want to share your package with the world, you can publish it to the npm registry. To do this, you need to create an account on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/) and then run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm publish
```

This command will package your project and upload it to the npm registry, making it available for others to install and use. Before publishing, make sure your `package.json` file is properly configured with the necessary information, such as name, version, description, and author.

- **Active Community**: Yarn has a vibrant and supportive user community.
- **Local Cache Installation**: Yarn can install packages from the local cache, speeding up the process.
- **Parallel Installation**: Yarn installs packages in parallel, which is faster than npm's sequential installation.
- **Version Binding**: It strongly binds package versions, ensuring consistency.

### Installing Yarn

To install Yarn, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can install Yarn globally using npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Alternatively, you can install Yarn using the official installer for your operating system. You can find the installation instructions on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

### Initializing a Project with Yarn

To start a new Node.js project with Yarn, you can use the following command to create a `package.json` file, which will hold information about your project and its dependencies:

```bash
yarn init
```

This command will prompt you to enter details about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, and more. After answering the prompts, a `package.json` file will be created in your project directory.

### Installing Packages with Yarn

To install a package using Yarn, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn add <package-name>
```

This command will download the specified package and its dependencies, placing them in the `node_modules` directory within your project. If you want to install a package globally (making it available system-wide), you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn global add <package-name>
```

### Managing Dependencies

Yarn allows you to manage your project's dependencies easily. You can specify which packages your project depends on in the `package.json` file. When you run `yarn install`, Yarn will read this file and install all the listed dependencies automatically.
You can also specify different types of dependencies, such as:

- **Dependencies**: Packages required for your project to run in production.
- **DevDependencies**: Packages needed only for development and testing purposes.

### Uninstalling Packages

To remove a package from your project, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

This command will remove the specified package from the `node_modules` directory and update the `package.json` file accordingly. If you want to uninstall a package globally, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn global remove <package-name>
```

### Updating Packages

To update a package to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn upgrade <package-name>
```

This command will check for the latest version of the specified package and update it if a newer version is available. If you want to update all packages in your project, you can simply run:

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

This will update all dependencies listed in your `package.json` file to their latest compatible versions.

### Running Scripts

Yarn allows you to define scripts in your `package.json` file that can be executed using the `yarn run` command. For example, you can define a script to start your application or run tests. Here's an example of how to define a script in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

You can then run these scripts using the following commands:

```bash
yarn start
yarn test
```

### Publishing Packages

If you want to share your package with the world, you can publish it to the Yarn registry. To do this, you need to create an account on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/) and then run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
yarn publish
```

This command will package your project and upload it to the Yarn registry, making it available for others to install and use. Before publishing, make sure your `package.json` file is properly configured with the necessary information, such as name, version, description, and author.

## Nvm

nvm (Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system. It enables you to switch between different Node.js versions easily, making it ideal for developers who work on multiple projects with varying Node.js requirements.

##### Key Features of Nvm

- **Version Management**: nvm allows you to install, uninstall, and switch between different versions of Node.js effortlessly.
- **Project Isolation**: You can set a specific Node.js version for each project, ensuring that your projects run with the correct version of Node.js.
- **Easy Installation**: nvm provides a simple command-line interface for installing and managing Node.js versions.

##### Benefits of Using Nvm

- **Flexibility**: nvm allows you to test your code against different Node.js versions, ensuring compatibility across various environments.
- **Simplicity**: It simplifies the process of managing Node.js versions, eliminating the need to manually install and configure different versions.
- **Community Support**: nvm has a large and active community, providing support and resources for users.

### Is Nvm Right for You?

If you are a Node.js developer who works on multiple projects or needs to test your code against different Node.js versions, nvm is an essential tool for your development workflow. It provides a convenient way to manage Node.js versions, ensuring that you can easily switch between them as needed.

### Nvm VS. Other Node.js Version Managers

While there are other Node.js version managers available, such as n and asdf, nvm is one of the most popular and widely used tools in the Node.js community. It offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface, making it easy for developers to manage Node.js versions without any hassle. Other version managers may have additional features or different approaches, but nvm remains a reliable choice for most Node.js developers.

### Nvm VS. Node.js Version Manager (N)

nvm and n are both popular tools for managing Node.js versions, but they have some differences in their approach and features. Here are some key differences:

- **Installation**: nvm is installed via a shell script, while n is installed via npm. This means that nvm requires a bit more setup initially, but it provides a more  solution for managing Node.js versions.
- **Version Management**: nvm allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js easily, while n focuses on installing the latest version of Node.js and switching to it. nvm provides more flexibility in managing different Node.js versions, making it suitable for developers who work on multiple projects with varying Node.js requirements.
- **Project Isolation**: nvm allows you to set a specific Node.js version for each project, ensuring that your projects run with the correct version of Node.js. This is particularly useful for developers who need to maintain compatibility across different projects. n does not provide this level of project isolation, making it less suitable for developers who work on multiple projects with different Node.js requirements.
- **Community Support**: nvm has a larger and more active community compared to n, providing better support and resources for users. This means that if you encounter any issues or need help with nvm, you are more likely to find solutions and assistance from the community.

```bash
nvm use <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the desired Node.js version to switch to that version.

- **Set a default version**:

```bash
nvm alias default <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the desired Node.js version to set it as the default version used when opening a new terminal session.

- **Uninstall a version**:

```bash
nvm uninstall <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the Node.js version you want to uninstall.

- **Check the current version**:

```bash
nvm current
```

This command will display the currently active Node.js version.

- **Update nvm**:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

This command will install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js.

- **Check for available Node.js versions**:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```
