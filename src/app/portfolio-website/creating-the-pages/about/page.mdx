                Hey there! I'm Emma, a passionate developer who believes that
                great code should be as satisfying as the perfect cup of coffee.
                When I'm not crafting digital experiences, you'll find me hiking
                mountain trails or experimenting with new recipes in my kitchen.

                I discovered programming during my Psychology degree (plot
                twist!) and fell in love with how technology can solve real
                human problems. Now I combine my understanding of human behavior
                with technical skills to create applications that people
                actually enjoy using.
