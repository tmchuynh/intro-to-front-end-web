# Contact Page

## Table of Contents

## About This Page

This page is designed to provide a contact form for users to reach out. It includes fields for the user's name, email, subject, and message. The form is styled with Tailwind CSS and uses React Hook Form for validation.

There are no specific utility functions or API calls on this page, as it is primarily focused on the form submission process.

Keep in mind that this page is part of a larger portfolio website, and it is designed to be responsive and user-friendly. The form submission will be handled by a backend service, which is not covered in this example.

## What You Should Include

- A contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- Validation for the form fields using React Hook Form.
- A submit button that triggers the form submission.
- A success message or error handling after form submission.

## Important Considerations

- Ensure that the form is accessible and user-friendly.
- Consider CAPTCHA integration (ie. reCAPTCHA, Google reCAPTCHA) to prevent spam submissions and honeypot attacks that include hidden fields that are not visible to users but can be filled by bots.
- Consider using custom input fields for better styling and user experience.
- Mapbox, Google Places API, or similar services can be integrated to offer address suggestions as users type, making it faster and more convenient for them to fill out the form.
- Ensure that the form is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Consider adding a confirmation message or redirecting users to a thank-you page after successful submission.
- Ensure that the form is secure and protects user data.
- Consider adding a privacy policy link to inform users about how their data will be used.
- If needed, include data pickers, time pickers, or other input types to enhance the user experience.
