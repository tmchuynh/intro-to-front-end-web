## About This Page

This page is designed to handle errors that may occur during the operation of the portfolio website. It provides a user-friendly message and a link to return to the home page. It is essential for maintaining a good user experience by guiding users back to a functional part of the site when an error occurs.

Even though this page is not directly linked to any specific functionality, it serves as a fallback for all error cases in the application. This ensures that users are not met with a blank screen or an unhelpful error message when something goes wrong.

This page comes up when the user tries to access a page that does not exist or when an unexpected error occurs in the application. It is a crucial part of the portfolio website's error handling strategy.
