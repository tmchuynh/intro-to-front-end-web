# Not-Found Page

## Table of Contents

## About This Page

This page is designed to handle cases where a user navigates to a route that does not exist within the application. It provides a user-friendly message indicating that the requested page could not be found.

Even though this page is not directly linked to any specific functionality, it serves as a fallback for all unmatched routes in the application. This ensures that users are not met with a blank screen or an error message when they attempt to access a non-existent page.

Though all your routes are defined and your links are working correctly, it's still a good practice to have a Not Found page in place. This page can be customized to include additional information, such as links to other parts of the site or a search bar to help users find what they are looking for. After all, it's better to guide users to the right place rather than leaving them lost in the void of the internet.

## What You Should Include

- A user-friendly message indicating that the page could not be found.
- A link back to the home page or other relevant sections of the site.
- Optional: A search bar or links to popular sections of the site to help users navigate.

## Important Considerations

- **SEO Considerations**: While Not Found pages are not indexed by search engines, it's still important to ensure that they provide a good user experience. Use appropriate HTTP status codes (like 404) to indicate that the page was not found.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the Not Found page is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.
- **Design Consistency**: Maintain the same design and branding as the rest of your site to provide a cohesive user experience.
- **Error Handling**: If your application uses data fetching, ensure that the Not Found page is rendered correctly even when data fetching fails or returns no results.
- **Testing**: Regularly test the Not Found page to ensure it works as expected and provides a good user experience.
