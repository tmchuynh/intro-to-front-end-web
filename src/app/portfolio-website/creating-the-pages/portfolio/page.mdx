# Portfolio Page

## Table of Contents

## About This Page

This page is designed to showcase the portfolio of a developer. It includes sections for the portfolio title, description, and a list of projects. The projects are displayed in a grid format, with each project showing its title, description, and a link to view more details.

This will be the main page where users can see the portfolio items. It will be linked from the homepage and will serve as a central hub for all portfolio-related content.

## What You Should Include

Since you will want to display your portfolio items, you should include the following for each project:

- **Title**: The name of the project.
- **Description**: A brief overview of what the project is about.
- **Link**: A link to view more details about the project. Either a link to a live demo or a GitHub repository.
- **Tags**: Keywords or tags that describe the project, which can help with filtering and searching.
- **Image**: A thumbnail or screenshot of the project.
- **Technologies Used**: A list of technologies or tools used in the project.
- **Date**: The date when the project was completed or published.
- **Category**: The category or type of project (e.g., web development, mobile app, etc.).

##### TIP

<blockquote>
All these items do not need to be displayed on the main portfolio page. You can choose to display only the title, description, and image, while the other details can be shown on a separate project detail page.

If you want to display more information about each project, consider creating a modal or a separate page that opens when a project is clicked. This can include more detailed information, such as the technologies used, links to the code repository, and a more extensive description.

This approach keeps the main portfolio page clean and focused while still providing access to detailed information about each project.

This will help users quickly scan through your projects and find the ones they are interested in, while also allowing them to dive deeper into specific projects if they choose to.

If you choose to implement separate project detail pages, you will want to use dynamic routing to create a unique URL for each project. This can be done using Next.js's file-based routing system, where you would create a folder named `[projectId]` inside the `portfolio` directory. Within that folder, you would create a `page.tsx` file that fetches and displays the details of the project based on the `projectId` parameter in the URL.

This way, when a user clicks on a project, they will be taken to a dedicated page that shows all the relevant information about that project.

The file structure would look like this:

```
portfolio/
  page.tsx          // Main portfolio page
    [projectId]/
      page.tsx      // Dynamic project detail page
```

More about this can be found in the [Project Details Page](/portfolio-website/creating-the-pages/project-details) section.

##### IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the page is mobile-friendly and looks good on all devices.
- **Accessibility**: Make sure the page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, provide alt text for images, and ensure keyboard navigation works.
- **Dark Mode**: Consider implementing a dark mode toggle for users who prefer a darker interface.
- **Performance**: Optimize images and assets to ensure fast loading times. Use lazy loading for images if necessary.

## Optional Features

- **Filter and Sort Options**: Allow users to filter projects by category or sort them by date or popularity.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar to help users find specific projects.
- **Pagination**: If you have many projects, consider implementing pagination to improve load times and user experience.
- **Animations**: Use subtle animations to enhance the user experience, such as hover effects on project cards.
