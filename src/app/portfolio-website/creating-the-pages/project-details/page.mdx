# Project Details Page

## Table of Contents

## About This Page

This page is designed to showcase the details of a specific project. It includes a header with the project title, a description, and a list of technologies used in the project. The page also features a link to the project's GitHub repository and a button to view the live project.

This will be the page where users can see the details of a specific project. It will be linked from the portfolio page and will serve as a detailed view of the project.

This page will be dynamically generated based on the project ID passed in the URL. This allows you to create a unique page for each project without having to create separate files for each one.

## Dynamic Routing

To create a dynamic project details page, you will need to use Next.js's file-based routing system. You will create a folder named `[projectId]` inside the `portfolio` directory. Within that folder, you will create a `page.tsx` file that fetches and displays the details of the project based on the `projectId` parameter in the URL.

The file structure would look like this:

```
portfolio/
  page.tsx          // Main portfolio page
  [projectId]/
    page.tsx      // Dynamic project detail page
```

## What You Should Include

Since you will want to display the details of each project, you should include the following:

- **Title**: The name of the project.
- **Description**: A detailed overview of what the project is about.
- **Technologies Used**: A list of technologies or tools used in the project.
- **GitHub Link**: A link to the project's GitHub repository.
- **Live Project Link**: A link to view the live project.
- **Image**: A thumbnail or screenshot of the project.
- **Date**: The date when the project was completed or published.
- **Category**: The category or type of project (e.g., web development, mobile app, etc.).

**TIP**

<blockquote>
  You can use the same data structure you created for the portfolio page to
  fetch the project details. This way, you can reuse the same data and avoid
  duplicating information. You can fetch the project details based on the
  `projectId` parameter in the URL and display the relevant information on the
  project details page.
