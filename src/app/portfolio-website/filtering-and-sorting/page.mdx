# Filtering and Sorting

## Table of Contents

## Filtering

Filtering is a crucial aspect of any portfolio website, allowing users to find specific projects or content based on their interests. In this section, we will explore how to implement filtering functionality in your portfolio website.

## Sorting

Sorting allows users to organize content in a way that makes sense to them, such as by date, popularity, or category. We will cover how to implement sorting features in your portfolio website.

## Strategies and Approaches for Filtering and Sorting

### Filtering Strategies

- **Category Filtering**: Let users filter projects by categories (e.g., _Web Development_, _Mobile Apps_, _Data Science_) using checkboxes or dropdowns.
- **Tag & Technology Filtering**: Enable filtering by multiple tags and technologies (e.g., _React_, _Node.js_, _Python_) via checkboxes or multi-select dropdowns. Users can select multiple options to narrow down results.
- **Cascading Filters**: Dynamically update available tags or technologies based on selected categories. For example, selecting _Web Development_ limits tags to _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_.
- **Search Functionality**: Provide a keyword search input to filter projects by title, description, or other metadata.
- **Date Filtering**: Let users filter by date ranges (e.g., _Last 30 Days_, _Last 6 Months_) using a date picker or predefined ranges.
- **Custom Filtering**: Allow users to create compound filters across categories, tags, and technologies for personalized results.
- **Visual Indicators**: Show icons or badges for active filters to improve clarity.
- **Filter Count**: Display the number of matching projects next to each filter option.
- **Reset Filters**: Include a reset button to clear all selected filters.

### Sorting Strategies

- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Let users sort projects by title (_A–Z_, _Z–A_).
- **Date Sorting**: Enable sorting by creation or update date (_Newest First_, _Oldest First_).
- **Popularity Sorting**: If available, allow sorting by metrics like _Views_, _Likes_, or _Ratings_.
- **Multi-Criteria Sorting**: Allow users to sort by multiple fields (e.g., _Date_, then _Title_) using a cascading or multi-select interface.
- **Custom Sorting**: Provide custom sort options based on user preferences.
- **Sorting Icons**: Display icons to indicate sort direction (ascending/descending).
- **Sorting Count**: Optionally show how many projects are affected after sorting.
- **Reset Sorting**: Offer a reset option to return to the default sorting order.

## Implementation Tips

- **State Management**: Use state management (e.g., React's useState or a global state management library) to keep track of selected filters and sorting options. This will allow you to dynamically update the displayed projects based on user selections.
- **Debouncing**: Implement debouncing for the search functionality to avoid excessive re-rendering and improve performance. This means that the search input will only trigger a search after the user has stopped typing for a certain period (e.g., 300 milliseconds).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that your filtering and sorting options are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance accessibility.
- **Performance Optimization**: If you have a large number of projects, consider implementing lazy loading or pagination to improve performance. This will ensure that only a subset of projects is loaded at a time, reducing the initial load time and improving user experience.
- **User Experience**: Make sure the filtering and sorting options are easy to use and intuitive. Use clear labels, tooltips, and visual cues to guide users through the process of filtering and sorting projects.
- **Testing**: Test the filtering and sorting functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected across different devices and browsers. Pay attention to edge cases, such as no projects matching the selected filters or sorting options.
- **Feedback**: Provide visual feedback when filters or sorting options are applied, such as highlighting selected options or displaying a message indicating the number of projects displayed after filtering or sorting.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure that the filtering and sorting options are responsive and work well on mobile devices. Consider using collapsible menus or dropdowns to save space on smaller screens.

## Components to Consider

- **Button**: A button to clear all selected filters and reset the view to show all projects.
- **Icons**: Use icons for visual cues, such as a filter icon next to the filter options and sort arrows next to sorting options.

### Filter Components

- **Checkboxes**: For category and tag filtering, use checkboxes to allow users to select multiple options easily.
- **Dropdowns**: For technology filtering, use multi-select dropdowns to let users choose multiple technologies.
- **Search Input**: A text input for keyword search, allowing users to type in keywords to filter projects.
- **Date Picker**: A date picker component for selecting date ranges for filtering projects by date.
- **Slider**: A slider component for filtering projects based on a numeric value, such as project ratings or view counts.
- **Accordion**: An accordion component to group filter options, allowing users to expand or collapse sections for better organization.

### Sort Components

- **Sort Dropdown**: A dropdown menu to select sorting options (e.g., _Alphabetical_, _Date_, _Popularity_).
- **Toggle Switch**: A toggle switch to change the sort direction (ascending/descending).
- **Group Toggle**: A toggle to group projects by category or technology, allowing users to see related projects together.

## Examples

### Example 1: Category Filtering with Checkboxes

- This example demonstrates how to implement category filtering using checkboxes. Users can select multiple categories to filter projects accordingly.
- The selected categories are stored in the component state, and the displayed projects are filtered based on the selected categories.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

### Example 2: Tag and Technology Filtering with Multi-Select Dropdowns

- This example shows how to implement tag and technology filtering using multi-select dropdowns. Users can select multiple tags and technologies to filter projects.
- The selected tags and technologies are stored in the component state, and the displayed projects are filtered based on the selected options.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

### Example 3: Search Functionality with Debouncing

- This example demonstrates how to implement a search input with debouncing. The search input allows users to type in keywords to filter projects by title or description.
- The search input uses a debounce function to delay the search operation until the user stops typing for a specified period, improving performance and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

### Example 4: Date Filtering with Date Picker

- This example shows how to implement date filtering using a date picker. Users can select a date range to filter projects based on their creation or update date.
- The selected date range is stored in the component state, and the displayed projects are filtered based on the selected date range.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

### Example 5: Sorting Projects by Date

- This example demonstrates how to implement sorting functionality for projects by date. Users can choose to sort projects by creation date or update date in ascending or descending order.
- The selected sorting option is stored in the component state, and the displayed projects are sorted accordingly.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

### Example 6: Filtering By Multiple Criteria

- This example shows how to implement filtering by multiple criteria, such as category, tags, and technologies. Users can select multiple options from each filter category to narrow down the displayed projects.
- The selected filters are combined to create a compound filter, and the displayed projects are updated based on the combined filter criteria.
- A cascading filter approach is used to dynamically update available tags and technologies based on the selected category.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```
