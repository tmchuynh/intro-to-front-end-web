# Routing Folders and Files

## Table of Contents

## Creating a New Route

- Create a new folder in the `app` directory.
- Name the folder according to the route you want to create.
- Inside the folder, create a file named `page.tsx`
- This file will contain the component that renders the content for that route.

The folder structure will look like this:

```
app/
  portfolio/
    page.tsx
```

## Dynamic Routes

You can create dynamic routes by using square brackets in the folder name.
For example, to create a dynamic route for a user's profile, you can create a folder named `[username]`.

The folder structure will look like this:

```
app/
  [username]/
    page.tsx
```

Here, `username` is a dynamic segment that can match any value. When a user visits `/john`, the `page.tsx` file inside the `[username]` folder will be rendered, and you can access the `username` parameter in your component.

You can access the dynamic parameter in your `page.tsx` file using the `params` object provided by Next.js:

```tsx
import { useParams } from "next/navigation";
export default function UserProfile() {
  const params = useParams();
  const username = params.username;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile: {username}</h1>
      {/* Render user profile content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Nested Routes

You can create nested routes by creating subfolders inside a route folder. For example, if you want to create a route for a user's posts, you can create a folder named `posts` inside the `[username]` folder.

The folder structure will look like this:

```txt
app/
├── [username]/
│   ├── page.tsx                    # User profile page (/john)
│   └── posts/
│       └── page.tsx                # User posts page (/john/posts)
```

In this case, the `page.tsx` file inside the `posts` folder will be rendered when a user visits `/john/posts`. You can access the dynamic parameter `username` in the nested route as well.

You can access the dynamic parameter in the nested `page.tsx` file using the `params` object:

```tsx
import { useParams } from "next/navigation";
export default function UserPosts() {
  const params = useParams();
  const username = params.username;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Posts: {username}</h1>
      {/* Render user posts content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Special Files

Next.js provides special files that can be used for specific purposes:

| File Name       | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `layout.tsx`    | Used to define a layout for the route. It can wrap the content of the route with common elements like headers, footers, or sidebars.              |
| `loading.tsx`   | Used to define a loading state for the route. It can be used to show a loading spinner or placeholder while the route is being loaded.            |
| `error.tsx`     | Used to define an error state for the route. It can be used to show an error message or fallback UI when an error occurs while loading the route. |
| `not-found.tsx` | Used to define a custom 404 page for the route. It can be used to show a custom message or UI when the route is not found.                        |

These files can be placed in the route folder alongside `page.tsx`.

The folder structure will look like this:

```
app/
└── [username]/
    ├── layout.tsx                  # Layout wrapper for user routes
    ├── loading.tsx                 # Loading UI for user profile
    ├── error.tsx                   # Error handling for user routes
    └── page.tsx                    # Main user profile page
```

In this example, the `layout.tsx` file will wrap the content of the route, the `loading.tsx` file will be shown while the route is loading, the `error.tsx` file will be shown if an error occurs, and the `page.tsx` file will render the main content of the route.

### Example of a Layout File for `[username]` Route

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ReactNode } from "react";
export default function UserLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <h1>User Profile</h1>
      </header>
      <main>{children}</main>
      <footer>
        <p>Footer content here</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example of a Loading File for `[username]` Route

```tsx
export default function UserLoading() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loading user profile...</h1>
      <p>Please wait while we load the user profile.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example of an Error File for `[username]` Route

```tsx
export default function UserError() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Error loading user profile</h1>
      <p>
        There was an error loading the user profile. Please try again later.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example of a Not Found File for `[username]` Route

```tsx
export default function UserNotFound() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Not Found</h1>
      <p>The user you are looking for does not exist.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Creating Your Folder Structure for the Portfolio Website

### Folder Structure

To create a portfolio website using Next.js, you can follow this folder structure:

```txt
app/
  portfolio/
    page.tsx
    projects/
      page.tsx
  about/
    page.tsx
  contact/
    page.tsx
  layout.tsx
  loading.tsx
  error.tsx
  not-found.tsx
```

In this structure:

- The `portfolio` folder contains the main portfolio page and a nested `projects` folder for the projects section.
- The `about` and `contact` folders contain the respective pages.
- The `layout.tsx` file can be used to define a common layout for the entire website.
- The `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` files can be used to handle loading states, errors, and 404 pages respectively.

If you remember the `<header>` component we created earlier, these routes have been linked to the components, waiting to be rendered with content.

### Skeletons for `page.tsx` Files

Here are the skeletons for the `page.tsx` files in each route:

```tsx
import React from "react";
export default function PortfolioPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>[Insert the name of the page here]</h1>
      {/* Add more content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### TIP

> Always name the function the same as the file name to avoid confusion. For example, if the file is `page.tsx`, the function should be named `PortfolioPage`.

## Next Steps

It's time to start filling in those pages!!
