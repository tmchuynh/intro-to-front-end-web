## Overview

This portfolio website is built using Next.js and TypeScript, showcasing my projects and skills. It integrates with a GitHub API to dynamically fetch and display my repositories, providing an up-to-date view of my work. The site is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a focus on performance and accessibility.

Creating a full-stack portfolio website using Next.js allows you to leverage its features for both front-end and back-end development, making it a powerful and efficient framework for building dynamic applications like portfolios or blogs.

### Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches GitHub repositories using the GitHub API.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing.
- **SEO Optimized**: Utilizes Next.js features for better search engine visibility.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Custom Components**: Modular components for easy maintenance and scalability.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building React applications with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **GitHub API**: For fetching repository data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Vercel**: Platform for deploying Next.js applications.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript and React.
  - If you are new to React, consider reviewing the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
- Familiarity with Next.js, TypeScript, and TSX.
  - If you are new to Next.js, check out the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A code editor (like VSCode) for development.
  - There is a [VSCode extension for Next.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zeit.next-vscode) that can enhance your development experience.
- Basic knowledge of Git for version control.
  - If you are new to Git, consider reviewing the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
- A GitHub account to host your code and showcase your projects.
  - If you don't have a GitHub account, you can sign up for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Project

Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to set up a new Next.js project.

- Choose TypeScript when prompted to use TypeScript.
- Navigate to your project directory.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

<br />
You will see the following prompts:

- What is your project named?
  - Enter your desired project name (e.g., `my-portfolio`).
- Would you like to use TypeScript?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable TypeScript support.
- Would you like to use ESLint?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable ESLint for code quality.
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
  - Choose `Yes` to enable Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?
  - Choose `Yes` to organize your code in a `src` directory.
- Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)
  - Choose `Yes` to use the App Router for routing.
- Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?
  - Choose `No` for now, as it is still experimental.
- Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?
  - Choose `No` for the default alias.

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest
✔ What is your project named? … my-portfolio
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes

```

### Initialize Git Repository

After creating your Next.js project, it's a good idea to initialize a Git repository to track changes and push it to GitHub for version control.

- Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin
git push -u origin main
```

This will create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support and set up a Git repository for version control.

### Install Dependencies

Add necessary packages like `tailwindcss`, `@headlessui/react`, `next-themes`, `react-icons`, `@heroicons/react`, `lucide-react`, `motion`, `embla-carousel`, `embla-carousel-autoplay`, and `embla-carousel-react` for styling and functionality.

- Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @headlessui/react next-themes react-icons @heroicons/react lucide-react motion embla-carousel embla-carousel-autoplay embla-carousel-react
```

### Project Structure

Look through the `src` directory to understand how the project is organized. We will be working primarily in the `app` directory, which contains the pages and components of the portfolio website.

<br />
<br />

Your file structure should look something like this:

```my-portfolio/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── eslint.config.mjs
├─] next-env.d.ts (ignored)
├── next.config.ts
├─] node_modules/ (ignored)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── public/
│   ├── file.svg
│   ├── globe.svg
│   ├── next.svg
│   ├── vercel.svg
│   └── window.svg
├── src/
│   └── app/
│       ├── favicon.ico
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
└── tsconfig.json
```

**NOTE**

> The `node_modules` directory is ignored in the file structure as it contains installed packages and is not necessary to include in version control. `next-env.d.ts` is also ignored as it is generated by Next.js and contains type definitions for the environment.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see your portfolio website in action, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view your portfolio website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see the default Next.js welcome page, which indicates that your project is set up correctly.

## Next Steps

Now that you have set up your Next.js project and installed the necessary dependencies, you can start building your portfolio website. The next steps will guide you through creating the main components, fetching data from the GitHub API, and styling your website using Tailwind CSS.

Let's dive into the next sections to learn how to create the main components of your portfolio website, fetch data from the GitHub API, and style your website using Tailwind CSS.
