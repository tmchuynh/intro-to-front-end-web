## Why are Classes Important?

Classes in TypeScript are essential for object-oriented programming. They allow you to create blueprints for objects, encapsulating data and behavior together. This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

### Example Usage

```typescript
// src/modules/person.model.ts

class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): string {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  position: string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, position: string) {
    super(name, age);
    this.position = position;
  }

  getDetails(): string {
    return `${this.greet()} I work as a ${this.position}.`;
  }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
  teamSize: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, position: string, teamSize: number) {
    super(name, age, position);
    this.teamSize = teamSize;
  }

  getTeamDetails(): string {
    return `${this.getDetails()} I manage a team of ${this.teamSize} people.`;
  }
}
const person = new Person("Alice", 30);
const employee = new Employee("Bob", 28, "Software Engineer");
const manager = new Manager("Charlie", 35, "Project Manager", 5);
console.log(person.greet());
console.log(employee.getDetails());
console.log(manager.getTeamDetails());
```

## Class Members

Classes can have various members, including properties and methods. Properties are variables that hold data, while methods are functions that define behavior.

```typescript
// src/modules/car.model.ts

class Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  getDetails(): string {
    return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
  }
}
const car = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
console.log(car.getDetails());
```

In this example, the `Car` class has three properties (`make`, `model`, and `year`) and a method (`getDetails`) that returns a string representation of the car.

### Members Types

Class members can have different types, including primitive types, arrays, and even other classes. You can also define methods that return specific types.

```typescript
// src/modules/product.model.ts
class Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, price: number) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  getPriceWithTax(taxRate: number): number {
    return this.price + this.price * taxRate;
  }
}
const product = new Product(1, "Laptop", 999.99);
console.log(
  `Product: ${product.name}, Price with tax: $${product.getPriceWithTax(0.2)}`,
);
```

### Members Visibility

Class members can have different visibility levels, which determine how they can be accessed. The most common visibility levels are `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

```typescript
// src/modules/user.model.ts
class User {
  public username: string;
  private password: string;
  protected email: string;

  constructor(username: string, password: string, email: string) {
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
    this.email = email;
  }

  public getUsername(): string {
    return this.username;
  }

  private getPassword(): string {
    return this.password;
  }

  protected getEmail(): string {
    return this.email;
  }
}
const user = new User("john_doe", "securePassword", "john_doe@sample.com");
console.log(`Username: ${user.getUsername()}`);
// The following lines would cause errors due to visibility restrictions
// console.log(user.getPassword()); // Error: Property 'getPassword' is private and only accessible within class 'User'.
// console.log(user.getEmail()); // Error: Property 'getEmail' is protected and only accessible within class 'User' and its subclasses.
```

### Static Members

Static members belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

```typescript
// src/utils/math.utils.ts
class MathUtils {
  static PI: number = 3.14159;

  static calculateCircleArea(radius: number): number {
    return this.PI * radius * radius;
  }
}
const area = MathUtils.calculateCircleArea(5);
console.log(`Area of circle with radius 5: ${area}`);
```

In this example, the `MathUtils` class has a static property `PI` and a static method `calculateCircleArea`. You can access these members without creating an instance of the class.

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility of class members. TypeScript provides three access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

```typescript
// src/modules/bank-account.model.ts
class BankAccount {
  private balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance: number) {
    this.balance = initialBalance;
  }

  public deposit(amount: number): void {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  public withdraw(amount: number): void {
    if (amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient funds.");
    }
  }

  public getBalance(): number {
    return this.balance;
  }
}
const account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(200);
console.log(`Current balance: $${account.getBalance()}`);
```

In this example, the `balance` property is marked as `private`, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. The `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance` methods are marked as `public`, allowing them to be called from outside the class.

```typescript
// src/modules/product.model.ts
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}
const product: Product = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 999.99,
}; // Object adhering to the Product interface
```

**\*Use case**: Access modifiers are useful for controlling access to class members, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and only accessible through defined methods.
| Access Modifier | Description | Use Case |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public` | Members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. | Use for properties and methods that need to be accessed or modified from outside the class. |
| `private` | Members are accessible only within the class itself, providing encapsulation. | Use for sensitive data that should not be exposed to the outside world, such as passwords. |
| `protected` | Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses, allowing controlled inheritance. | Use for properties that should be accessible to subclasses but hidden from external code. |
| `readonly` | Members can only be assigned a value once, either during declaration or in the constructor. | Use for constants or immutable values that should not change after initialization. |

###### Benefits of Access Modifiers

- Encapsulation: Access modifiers help encapsulate class members, protecting sensitive data and ensuring that it can only be accessed through defined methods.
- Controlled access: They allow you to control how class members can be accessed, providing a way to enforce rules and maintain the integrity of the class.

### Public Properties

Public properties are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. They are the default visibility level for class members.

```typescript
// src/modules/person.model.ts

class Person {
  public name: string;
  public age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  introduce(): string {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}
const person = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(person.introduce());
```

**Use case**: Public properties are commonly used for data that needs to be accessed or modified from outside the class, such as user information in a profile class.

###### Benefits of Public Properties

- Easy access: Public properties can be accessed directly from instances of the class, making them convenient for data retrieval and modification.
- Flexibility: They allow for easy interaction with class instances, enabling straightforward data manipulation.

### Private Properties

Private properties are only accessible within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, providing encapsulation and protecting sensitive data.

```typescript
// src/modules/bank-account.model.ts
class BankAccount {
  private balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance: number) {
    this.balance = initialBalance;
  }

  deposit(amount: number): void {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  withdraw(amount: number): void {
    if (amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient funds.");
    }
  }

  getBalance(): number {
    return this.balance;
  }
}
const account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(200);
console.log(`Current balance: $${account.getBalance()}`);
// The following line would cause an error because balance is private
// console.log(account.balance); // Error: Property 'balance' is private and only accessible within class 'BankAccount'.
```

**Use case**: Private properties are useful for sensitive data that should not be exposed to the outside world, such as account balances in a banking application.

###### Benefits of Private Properties

- Data protection: Private properties help protect sensitive information by restricting access to the class itself.
- Encapsulation: They promote encapsulation by ensuring that the internal state of the class cannot be modified directly from outside, allowing for controlled access through methods.
- Maintainability: Changes to private properties can be made without affecting external code, as they are not exposed outside the class.

### Protected Properties

Protected properties are similar to private properties, but they can also be accessed in subclasses. This allows for controlled inheritance while still protecting the property from outside access.

```typescript
// src/modules/vehicle.model.ts
class Vehicle {
  protected speed: number;

  constructor(speed: number) {
    this.speed = speed;
  }

  protected getSpeed(): number {
    return this.speed;
  }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
  private model: string;

  constructor(speed: number, model: string) {
    super(speed);
    this.model = model;
  }

  getCarDetails(): string {
    return `Car model: ${this.model}, Speed: ${this.getSpeed()} km/h`;
  }
}
const car = new Car(120, "Toyota Camry");
console.log(car.getCarDetails());
// The following line would cause an error because speed is protected
// console.log(car.speed); // Error: Property 'speed' is protected and only accessible within class 'Vehicle' and its subclasses.
```

**Use case**: Protected properties are useful when you want to allow subclasses to access certain properties while keeping them hidden from the outside world, such as speed in a vehicle class hierarchy.

###### Benefits of Protected Properties

- Controlled inheritance: Protected properties allow subclasses to access and modify properties while keeping them hidden from external code, promoting encapsulation.
- Flexibility: They provide a way to share data between a base class and its subclasses without exposing it to the outside world.

### Readonly Properties Readonly Properties are Properties That Can Only Be
assigned a value once, either during declaration or in the constructor. They
cannot be modified afterward.

```typescript
// src/modules/point.model.ts
class Point {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  getCoordinates(): string {
    return `(${this.x}, ${this.y})`;
  }
}
const point = new Point(10, 20);
console.log(`Point coordinates: ${point.getCoordinates()}`);
// The following line would cause an error because x is readonly
// point.x = 15; // Error: Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property.
```

**Use case**: Readonly properties are useful for defining constants or immutable values that should not change after initialization, such as coordinates in a point class.

###### Benefits of Readonly Properties

- Immutability: Readonly properties ensure that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed, providing a guarantee of immutability.
- Safety: They help prevent accidental modifications to important values, reducing the risk of bugs in the code.

### Parameter Properties

Parameter properties allow you to define class properties directly in the constructor parameters, reducing boilerplate code.

```typescript
// src/modules/rectangle.model.ts
class Rectangle {
  constructor(
    public width: number,
    public height: number,
  ) {}

  getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(`Area of rectangle: ${rectangle.getArea()}`);
```

In this example, the `width` and `height` properties are defined directly in the constructor parameters, making the code more concise.

**Use case**: Parameter properties are useful for simplifying class definitions, especially when you need to initialize properties directly from constructor parameters, such as dimensions in a rectangle class.

###### Benefits of Parameter Properties

- Conciseness: They reduce boilerplate code by allowing you to define and initialize properties in a single step, making the class definition cleaner and easier to read.
- Clarity: Parameter properties make it clear which parameters are intended to be class properties, improving code readability and maintainability.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This promotes code reuse and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.

```typescript
// src/modules/animal.model.ts
class Animal {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak(): string {
    return `${this.name} makes a sound.`;
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  speak(): string {
    return `${this.name} barks.`;
  }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
  speak(): string {
    return `${this.name} meows.`;
  }
}
const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
const cat = new Cat("Whiskers");
console.log(dog.speak());
console.log(cat.speak());
```

In this example, the `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class. They override the `speak` method to provide specific behavior for each animal type.

**Use case**: Inheritance is useful when you want to create specialized classes that share common behavior and properties, such as different types of animals inheriting from a base `Animal` class.

| Pros of Inheritance                                                                                                                                  | Cons of Inheritance                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code reuse: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from a base class, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.                              | Tight coupling: Inheritance creates a strong relationship between the base class and derived classes, making changes in the base class potentially affect all derived classes. |
| Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, allowing you to treat derived class instances as instances of the base class, enhancing flexibility. | Fragile base class problem: Changes in the base class can lead to unexpected behavior in derived classes, making the codebase harder to maintain.                              |
| Hierarchical structure: Inheritance establishes a clear hierarchy, making it easier to understand the relationships between classes.                 | Limited flexibility: Inheritance can lead to rigid class structures, making it difficult to adapt to changes in requirements or design.                                        |
