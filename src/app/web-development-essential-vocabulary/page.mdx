| **Microservices**                  | An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices promote flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in large applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **GraphQL**                        | A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST APIs, enabling developers to define the structure of the response and retrieve multiple resources in a single request. GraphQL is often used in modern web applications to improve data fetching and reduce over-fetching or under-fetching of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Serverless Architecture**        | A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Developers can build and run applications without worrying about server management, allowing them to focus on writing code. Serverless architectures often use functions as a service (FaaS) to execute code in response to events, such as HTTP requests or database changes. This approach can lead to cost savings and improved scalability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Containerization**               | A lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Docker is a popular tool for creating and managing containers, enabling developers to build, ship, and run applications easily. Containerization simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of applications, making it a key technology in modern software development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** | A distributed network of servers that delivers web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs improve the performance and availability of websites by caching static assets (like images, stylesheets, and scripts) on servers closer to the user. This reduces latency and speeds up page load times, enhancing the overall user experience. CDNs also provide additional benefits such as load balancing, DDoS protection, and improved security. Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, and Amazon CloudFront. By using a CDN, developers can ensure that their web applications are fast, reliable, and scalable, even during traffic spikes or high demand. CDNs are essential for delivering content efficiently and improving the performance of web applications, especially for global audiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Progressive Web App (PWA)**      | A type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience. PWAs can work offline, send push notifications, and be installed on a user's device, providing a seamless experience similar to native apps. They combine the best features of web and mobile applications, allowing users to access content quickly and reliably, even in low or no connectivity situations. PWAs are built using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them accessible across different platforms and devices. They are designed to be responsive, fast, and engaging, providing users with a smooth and reliable experience. PWAs can be added to the home screen of a device, allowing users to launch them like native apps, and they can also be indexed by search engines, improving discoverability. By leveraging service workers, web app manifests, and other modern web APIs, PWAs offer a powerful way to create high-quality web applications that provide users with a native app-like experience while maintaining the advantages of the web. PWAs are becoming increasingly popular as they allow developers to reach a wider audience without the need for separate app stores or installations, making them a versatile and efficient solution for delivering web applications. |
